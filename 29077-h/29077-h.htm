<h5>NOTE ON THE MAP OF CONSTANTINOPLE</h5>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>For the map forming the frontispiece and the following note I am
greatly indebted to Mr. F. W. Hasluck, of the British School at
Athens.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The map is taken from the unpublished <i>Insularium Henrici
Martelli Germani</i> (<i>B.M. Add. MSS.</i> 15,760) f. 40.</p>

<p>A short note on the MS., which may be dated approximately 1490,
is given in the <i>Annual of the British School at Athens</i>, xii.
199.</p>

<p>The map of Constantinople is a derivative of the Buondelmontius
series, which dates from 1420, and forms the base of all known maps
prior to the Conquest. Buondelmontius' map of Constantinople has
been published from several MSS., varying considerably in legend
and other details:<a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> the
best account of these publications is to be found in E.
Oberhummer's <i>Konstantinopel unter Suleiman dem Grossen</i>, pp.
18 ff. The map in B.M. <i>Arundel</i>, 93, has since been published
in <i>Annual B.S.A.</i> xii. pl. i.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>In the present map the legends are as follows. Those marked with
a dagger do not occur on hitherto published maps.</p>

<p>Reference is made below to the Paris MS. (best published by
Oberhummer, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the Venetian (Mordtmann,
<i>Esquisse</i>, p. 45, Sathas,
&#924;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;, iii., frontispiece), and
the Vatican (Mordtmann, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 73).</p>

<h4>PREFACE</h4>

<p>This volume is a sequel to the work I published, several years
ago, under the title, <i>Byzantine Constantinople: the Walls of the
City, and adjoining Historical Sites</i>. In that work the city was
viewed, mainly, as the citadel of the Roman Empire in the East, and
the bulwark of civilization for more than a thousand years. But the
city of Constantine was not only a mighty fortress. It was,
moreover, the centre of a great religious community, which
elaborated dogmas, fostered forms of piety, and controlled an
ecclesiastical administration that have left a profound impression
upon the thought and life of mankind. New Rome was a Holy City. It
was crowded with churches, hallowed, it was believed, by the
remains of the apostles, prophets, saints, and martyrs of the
Catholic Church; shrines at which men gathered to worship, from
near and far, as before the gates of heaven. These sanctuaries
were, furthermore, constructed and beautified after a fashion which
marks a distinct and important period in the history of art, and
have much to interest the artist and the architect. We have,
consequently, reasons enough to justify our study of the churches
of Byzantine Constantinople.</p>

<p>Of the immense number of the churches which once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span> filled
the city but a small remnant survives. Earthquakes, fires, pillage,
neglect, not to speak of the facility with which a Byzantine
structure could be shorn of its glory, have swept the vast majority
off the face of the earth, leaving not a rack behind. In most cases
even the sites on which they stood cannot be identified. The places
which knew them know them no more. Scarcely a score of the old
churches of the city are left to us, all with one exception
converted into mosques and sadly altered. The visitor must,
therefore, be prepared for disappointment. Age is not always a
crown of glory; nor does change of ownership and adaptation to
different ideas and tastes necessarily conduce to improvement. We
are not looking at flowers in their native clime or in full bloom,
but at flowers in a herbarium so to speak, or left to wither and
decay. As we look upon them we have need of imagination to see in
faded colours the graceful forms and brilliant hues which charmed
and delighted the eyes of men in other days.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this work I have availed myself of the aid
afforded by previous students in the same field of research, and I
have gratefully acknowledged my debt to them whenever there has
been occasion to do so. At the same time this is a fresh study of
the subject, and has been made with the hope of confirming what is
true, correcting mistakes, and gathering additional information.
Attention has been given to both the history and the architecture
of these buildings. The materials for the former are,
unfortunately, all too scanty. No continuous records of any of
these churches exist. A few incidents scattered over wide tracts of
time constitute all that can be known. Still, disconnected
incidents though they be, they give us glimpses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span> of the
characteristic thoughts and feelings of a large mass of our
humanity during a long period of history.</p>

<p>The student of the architecture of these churches likewise
labours under serious disadvantages. Turkish colour-wash frequently
conceals what is necessary for a complete survey; while access to
the higher parts of a building by means of scaffolding or ladders
is often impossible under present circumstances. Hence the
architect cannot always speak positively, and must leave many an
interesting point in suspense.</p>

<p>Care has been taken to distinguish the original parts of a
building from alterations made in Byzantine days or since the
Turkish conquest; while, by the prominence given to the variety of
type which the churches present, the life and movement observable
in Byzantine ecclesiastical art has been made clear, and the common
idea that it was a stereotyped art has been proved to be without
foundation.</p>

<p>Numerous references to the church of S. Sophia occur in the
course of this volume, but the reader will not find that great
monument of Byzantine architectural genius dealt with in the
studies here offered. The obstacles in the way of a proper
treatment of that subject proved insuperable, while the writings of
Salzenberg, Lethaby, and Swainson, and especially the splendid and
exhaustive monograph of my friend Mr. E. M. Antoniadi, seemed to
make any attempt of mine in the same direction superfluous if not
presumptuous. The omission will, however, secure one advantage: the
churches actually studied will not be overshadowed by the grandeur
of the 'Great Church,' but will stand clear before the view in all
the light that beats upon them.</p>

<p>I recall gratefully my obligations to the Sultan's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span> Government and
to the late Sir Nicholas O'Conor, British Ambassador at
Constantinople, for permission to make a scientific examination of
the churches of the city. To the present British Ambassador, Sir
Gerard Lowther, best thanks are due for the facilities enjoyed in
the study of the church of S. Irene.</p>

<p>I have been exceedingly fortunate in the architects who have
given me the benefit of their professional knowledge and skill in
the execution of my task, and I beg that their share in this work
should be recognized and appreciated as fully as it deserves. To
the generosity of the British School at Athens I am indebted for
being able to secure the services of Mr. Ramsay Traquair, Associate
of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Lecturer on
Architecture at the College of Art in Edinburgh. Mr. Traquair spent
three months in Constantinople for the express purpose of
collecting the materials for the plans, illustrations, and notes he
has contributed to this work. The chapter on Byzantine Architecture
is entirely from his pen. He has also described the architectural
features of most of the churches; but I have occasionally
introduced information from other sources, or given my own personal
observations.</p>

<p>I am likewise under deep obligation to Mr. A. E. Henderson,
F.S.A., for the generous kindness with which he has allowed me to
reproduce his masterly plans of the churches of SS. Sergius and
Bacchus, S. Mary Panachrantos, and many of his photographs and
drawings of other churches in the city. I am, moreover, indebted to
the Byzantine Research and Publication Fund for courteous
permission to present here some of the results of the splendid work
done by Mr. W. S. George, F.S.A., under unique circumstances,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span> in the
study of the church of S. Irene, and I thank Mr. George personally
for the cordial readiness with which he consented to allow me even
to anticipate his own monograph on that very interesting fabric. It
is impossible to thank Professor Baldwin Brown, of the University
of Edinburgh, enough, for his unfailing kindness whenever I
consulted him in connection with my work. Nor do I forget how much
I owe to J. Meade Falkner, Esq., for kindly undertaking the irksome
task of revising the proofs of the book while going through the
press.</p>

<p>I cannot close without calling attention to the brighter day
which has dawned on the students of the antiquities of
Constantinople since constitutional government has been introduced
in the Ottoman Empire. Permission to carry on excavations in the
city has been promised me. The archaeology of New Rome only waits
for wealthy patrons to enable it to reach a position similar to
that occupied by archaeological research in other centres of
ancient and mediaeval civilizations. But the monuments of the olden
time are perishable. Of the churches described by Paspates in his
<i>Byzantine Studies</i>, published in 1877, nine have either
entirely disappeared or lost more of their original features. It
was no part of wisdom to let the books of the cunning Sibyl become
rarer and knowledge poorer by neglecting to secure all that was
obtainable when she made her first or even her second offer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>BYZANTINE ARCHITECTURE</h4>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">I. Planning</span></div>

<p>At the beginning of the fifth century, which is a suitable point
from which to date the rise of Byzantine architecture, three
principal types of church plan prevailed in the Roman
world:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The Basilica: an oblong hall divided into nave and aisles,
and roofed in wood, as in the Italian and Salonican examples, or
with stone barrel-vaults, as in Asia Minor and Central Syria.</p>

<p>II. The Octagonal or Circular plan covered with a stone or brick
dome, a type which may be subdivided according as (1) the dome
rests upon the outer walls of the building, or (2) on columns or
piers surrounded by an ambulatory.</p>

<p>The Pantheon and the so-called Temple of Minerva Medica at Rome
are early examples of the first variety, the first circular, the
second a decagon in plan. S. George at Salonica is a later circular
example. An early instance of the second variety is found in S.
Constanza at Rome, and a considerable number of similar churches
occur in Asia Minor, dating from the time of Constantine the Great
or a little later.</p>

<p>III. The Cross plan. Here we have a square central area covered
by a dome, from which extend four vaulted arms constituting a
cross. This type also assumes two distinct forms:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>(1) Buildings in which the ground plan is
cruciform, so that the cross shows externally at the ground level.
Churches of this class are usually small, and were probably
sepulchral chapels rather than churches for public worship. A good
example is the tomb of Galla Placidia at Ravenna.</p>

<p>(2) In the second form of the Cross church the cross is enclosed
within a square, and appears only above the roofs of the angle
chambers. An example is seen in the late Roman tomb at Kusr en
N&ucirc;eij&icirc;s in Eastern Palestine. In this instance the
central square area is covered with a dome on continuous
pendentives; the four arms have barrel-vaults, and the angles of
the cross are occupied by small chambers, which bring the
ground-plan to the square. The building is assigned to the second
century, and shows that true though continuous pendentives were
known at an early date<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> (Fig. <a href="#fig_8">
8</a>).</p>

<p>Another example is the Praetorium at Musmiyeh, in Syria,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11">
</a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> which probably dates from between 160 and 169
A.D. At some later time it was altered to a church, and by a
curious foreshadowing of the late Byzantine plan the walls of the
internal cross have entirely disappeared from the ground-plan. The
dome rests on four columns placed at the inner angles of the cross,
and the vaulted cross arms rest on lintels spanning the space
between the columns and the outer walls.</p>

<p>From these three types of building are derived the various
schemes on which the churches of the Byzantine Empire were
planned.</p>

<p>Of the basilican form the only example in Constantinople that
retains its original plan is S. John the Baptist of the Studion (<a
href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>), erected <i>c</i>. 463 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus (p. <a href="#Page_70">
70</a>) and the baptistery of S. Sophia (p.<a href="#Page_78">
78</a>) represent respectively the two varieties of the octagonal
plan. In the former the dome rests on piers surrounded by an
ambulatory; in the latter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">3</a></span>the dome rests upon the outer walls of the
buildings. Both are foundations of Justinian the Great.</p>

<p>Of the Cross church plan showing the cross externally at the
ground level no example survives in the city. But at least one
church of that form was seen at Constantinople in the case of the
church of the Holy Apostles. This was essentially a mausoleum,
built originally by Constantine the Great and reconstructed by
Justinian to contain the sarcophagi of the sovereigns and the
patriarchs of New Rome.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The church of S. Mark at Venice was built on the plan of the
Holy Apostles. It is a cruciform church with aisles, but the
galleries which might have been expected above them are omitted.
The central dome rests on four piers, and four smaller domes cover
the arms.</p>

<p>Professor Strzygowski gives examples of cross-planned cells in
the catacombs of Palmyra,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
and in many Eastern rock tombs.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
Such cross plans are found also in the Roman catacombs. These
subterranean chapels, of course, do not show the external
treatment, yet there can be little doubt that the external cross
plan was originally sepulchral, and owes its peculiar system of
planning to that fact. On the other hand, it was adopted in such
churches as S. Mark's at Venice and in the French examples of
P&eacute;rigord for aesthetic or traditional reasons.</p>

<p>In passing now to a consideration of the distinct forms
developed from these pre-Byzantine types of church building, the
classification adopted by Professor Strzygowski may be followed. In
his <i>Kleinasien</i> he has brought forward a series of buildings
which show the manner in which a dome was fitted to the oblong
basilica, producing the domed basilica
(<i>K&uuml;ppelbasilica</i>), an evolution which he regards as
Hellenistic and Eastern. In contrast to this, Strzygowski
distinguishes the domed cross church
(<i>Kreutzk&uuml;ppelkirche</i>), of which S. Theodosia in
Constantinople (p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>) is the typical
example and which is a Western development. A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>comparison of
the two forms is of great importance for the study of certain
Constantinople churches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="fig_1" id="fig_1"></a>
<img class="noborder" src="images/fig_1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Fig. 1.&mdash;Kasr Ibn Wardan (Strzygowski)." title="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;Kasr Ibn
Wardan</span> (Strzygowski).</p>
</div>

<p>The domed basilica, as the name indicates, is a basilica with
nave and aisles, in which a square bay in the centre of the nave is
covered by a dome on pendentives. To north and south, within the
arches supporting the dome, appear the nave and gallery arcades of
the basilica; and as the galleried basilica is a usual Eastern form
galleries are usual in the domed basilica. As seen from the central
area, therefore, the north and south dome arches are filled in with
arcades in two stories, and the side aisles and galleries are
covered with barrel vaults running parallel to the axis of the
church. At the west end a gallery over the narthex may unite the
two side galleries. At Kasr ibn Wardan, instanced by Strzygowski as
a typical domed basilica,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
there is such a western gallery (Fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>).
According to Strzygowski the domed basilica is older than the fifth
century.</p>

<p>The domed basilica remains always an oblong building, and whilst
the two sides to north and south are symmetrical, the western end
retains the basilican characteristics&mdash;it has no gallery or
arcade communicating with the central area. The narthex
communicates with the nave by doors, and if a gallery is placed
above it, both narthex and gallery are covered by barrel
vaults.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>In the domed cross church (<i>Kreutzk&uuml;ppelkirche</i>) the
central dome rests on barrel vaults which extend to the outer walls
of the building and form the arms of the cross, the eastern arm
forming the bema. The lighting of the church is by windows in the
gable walls which terminate the north, south, and west cross arms.
The prothesis and diaconicon open off the side arms, and two small
chambers in the western angles of the cross bring the plan
externally to the usual rectangular form.</p>

<p>The domed cross church may have galleries, as in S. Theodosia
(p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>), or may be without them, as in SS.
Peter and Mark (p. <a href="#Page_193">193</a>). Where galleries
are present they are placed in the cross arms and are supported by
arcades at the ground level. The vaults beneath the galleries are
cross-groined. The domed cross church is a centrally planned
church, in contrast to the domed basilica, which is oblong, and
therefore we should expect that where galleries are used they will
be formed in all three arms of the cross, as is the case in S.
Theodosia.</p>

<p>There are a number of churches which vary from these types, but
which can generally be placed in one class or the other by the
consideration of two main characteristics: if the dome arches
extend to the outer walls the building is a domed cross church; if
the galleries are screened off from the central area by arcades the
building is a domed basilica.</p>

<p>The church at Der&egrave; Aghsy,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
for instance, if we had only the plan to guide us, would appear to
be a typical domed basilica (Fig. <a href="#fig_2">2</a>), but on
examining the section we find that the north and south dome arches
extend over the galleries to the outer walls and form cross arms
(Fig. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>). The building is, in fact, a domed
cross church with no gallery in the western arm. Above the narthex
at the west end, and separated from the western cross arm, is a
gallery of the type usual in the domed basilica, so that
Der&egrave; Aghsy may be regarded as a domed cross church with
features derived from the domed basilica. S. Sophia at
Constantinople, the highest development of the domed basilica, has
a very similar western gallery.</p>

<p>The church of S. Nicholas at Myra<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
(Fig. <a href="#fig_4">4</a>) has a gallery at the west end, but
the cross arms do not appear to be carried over the galleries. The
plan is oblong and the cross-groined vault is not used. The church,
therefore, takes its place as a domed basilica.</p>

<a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
(Figs. <a href="#fig_5">5</a> and <a href="#fig_6">6</a>) has no
galleries to the sides. The aisles open into the central area by
arcades, above which are triple windows over the aisle vaults. At
the western end is a gallery above the narthex. The aisles are
barrel-vaulted, and as the church is planned on an axis from east
to west, and is not symmetrical on all three sides, it is regarded
as a domed basilica. It is such a form as might be developed from a
basilica without galleries.</p>

<p>In Constantinople there are three churches which seem to
constitute a type apart, though resembling in many ways the types
just considered. They are S. Andrew in Krisei, (<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>), S. Mary
Pammakaristos (<a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>), and S. Mary
Panachrantos (<a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>). In these churches, as originally built,
the central dome is carried on four arches which rise above a
one-storied aisle or ambulatory, allowing of windows <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>in the dome
arches on three sides&mdash;the eastern dome arch being prolonged
to form the bema. The dome arches have arcades communicating with
the ambulatory on the north, south, and west. The vaulting is
executed either with barrel or with cross-groined vaults. These
churches are evidently planned from a centre, not, like the domed
basilicas, from a longitudinal axis. At the same time the absence
of any cross arms differentiates them from the domed cross
churches. S. Andrew, which still retains its western arcade, dates
from at least the sixth century, so that the type was in use during
the great period of Byzantine architecture. Indeed, we should be
inclined to regard S. Andrew as a square form of SS. Sergius and
Bacchus, but without galleries. The type is a natural development
from the octagonal domed church with its surrounding
ambulatory.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

Church of the Koimesis, Nicaea</span> (Wulf).</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>The typical late Byzantine church is a
development from the domed cross plan. In three examples in
Constantinople, S. Theodosia (pp. <a href="#Page_170">170,</a>
<a href="#Page_172">172</a>), S. Mary Diaconissa (<a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>), and SS. Peter and Mark (<a href="#Page_193">p. 193</a>),
we can trace the gradual disappearance of
the galleries. S. Theodosia, as has already been mentioned, has
galleries in all three cross arms. In S. Mary Diaconissa they are
confined to the four angles between the cross arms; SS. Peter and
Mark is a simple cross plan without galleries. In later times it
became customary to build many small churches, with the result that
the chambers at the angles of the cross, of little account even in
a large church, were now too diminutive to be of any value, and the
question how to provide as much room as possible for the
worshippers became paramount. Accordingly the dome piers were
reduced to mere columns connected with the outer walls of the
building by arches; and thus was produced the typical late
Byzantine plan&mdash;at the ground level a square, enclosing four
columns; above, a Greek cross with a dome on the centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.&mdash;The
Church of the Koimesis, Nicaea</span> (Rott).</p>
</div>

<p>From its distinguishing feature this type has been styled the
'four column' plan. It appears in many Constantinopolitan churches,
as, for example, S. Theodore (p. <a href="#Page_248">248</a>) and
S. Saviour Pantepoptes (p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>). The cross
arms are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> not always equal, and may be covered with
barrel vaults (p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a> or with cross-groined
vaults (p. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>). The bema is usually a bay
added to the eastern arm. The angle chambers have either
cross-groined vaults or flat dome vaults. In general the churches
of this type in Constantinople do not differ from the numerous
churches of the same class in the provinces.<a name="FNanchor_19"
id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>A lobed cruciform plan is found in only one church in
Constantinople, that of S. Mary of the Mongols (<a href="#Page_277">p. 277</a>). Here the central dome is supported on four
piers set across the angles of the square, so that the pendentives
do not come to a point as usual, but spring from the face of the
piers. Against each side of the square a semidome is set, thus
producing a quatrefoil plan at the vaulting level.</p>

<p>Both trefoiled and quatrefoiled churches are not uncommon in
Armenia, such as the cathedral at Etschmiadzin;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> trefoiled churches of a later date are found in
the western provinces, and examples have been published from
Servia,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Salonica,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and Greece.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>An unusual form of the cross plan is seen in the building known
as Sanjakdar Mesjedi (p. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>), where a
cross is placed within an octagon. Probably the building was not
originally a church. It resembles the octagon near the Pantokrator
(p. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>), and may, like it, have been a
library.</p>

<p><i>Single Hall Churches.</i>&mdash;The plans hitherto considered
have all been characterised by the presence of aisles, galleries,
or other spaces adjoining the central area. The churches of the
present class consist simply of an oblong hall, terminating in an
apse, and either roofed in wood, or covered with domes placed
longitudinally, and resting to north and south on wall arches.
Examples of this plan are found in Monastir Mesjedi (<a href="#Page_264">p. 264</a>),
S. Thekla (p. <a href="#Page_211">
211</a>), Bogdan Serai (p. <a href="#Page_284">284</a>), and in the
memorial chapels attached to the Pantokrator (<a href="#Page_235">p. 235</a>),
and the Chora (p. <a href="#Page_309">309</a>).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
In the case of these two memorial chapels,
their narrow, long-stretched plan is evidently due to the desire to
keep their eastern apses in line with the east end of the churches
they adjoin, and at the same time to bring the western end to the
narthex from which they were entered. They are covered with two
domes, a system perhaps derived from S. Irene (<a href="#Page_94">p. 94</a>).
Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi (<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>),
which at first sight resembles a single
hall church roofed, in wood, was a refectory. Its plan may be
compared with that of the refectory at the monastery of S. Luke at
Stiris.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">II. Architectural Features
and Details</span></div>

<p><i>Apses.</i>&mdash;A fully developed Byzantine church
terminated in three apses: a large apse, with the bema or
presbytery, in the centre; on the right, the apse of the prothesis
where the sacrament was prepared; on the left, the apse of the
diaconicon, where the sacred vessels were kept. Although there is
proof that the prothesis and the diaconicon were in use at a very
early period, yet many churches of the great period, as for example
S. John of the Studion, SS. Sergius and Bacchus, and S. Sophia,
dispensed with these chambers as distinct parts of the building.
They were also omitted in small churches of a late date, where they
were replaced by niches on either side of the bema. The three apses
usually project from the east wall of the church, but occasionally
<a href="#Page_248">p. 248</a>) the two lateral apses are sunk in
the wall, and only the central apse shows on the exterior. As a
rule the apses are circular within and polygonal without. It is
rare to find them circular on both the interior and the exterior
(p. <a href="#Page_203">203</a>), and in Greece such a feature is
generally an indication of late date. An octagonal plan, in which
three sides of the octagon appear, sometimes with short returns to
the wall, is the most common; but in later churches polygons of
more sides are used, especially for the central apse, and these are
often very irregularly set out. Some of the churches of
Constantinople show five, and even seven sides.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bema.</i>&mdash;The bema is rectangular, and sometimes has
concave niches on each side (p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>). It is
covered either with a barrel or with a cross-groined vault, and
communicates with the prothesis and the diaconicon.</p>

<p><i>Prothesis and Diaconicon.</i>&mdash;These chambers are either
square (p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>) or have a long limb to the
east resembling a miniature bema (p. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>).
They are lower than the central apse and the cross arms, so that
the cruciform figure of the church shows clearly above them on the
exterior,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> though in some churches with
galleries small chapels overlooking the bema are placed above them
at the gallery level (S. Theodosia). They have usually a niche on
three sides, and are either dome vaulted or have cross-groined
vaults. The combination of a cross-groined vault with four niches
springing from the vaulting level is particularly effective. In S.
Saviour in the Chora (p. <a href="#Page_307">307</a>) these
chambers are covered with drum domes, pierced with windows, but
this treatment is quite exceptional.</p>

<p><i>The Gynecaeum.</i>&mdash;In the development of church
building, the gynecaeum, or gallery for women, tends to become less
and less important. In S. Sophia, S. Irene, and S. Theodosia, the
gallery is a part of the structure. In S. Mary Diaconissa (<a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>) it is reduced to four boxes at the angles
of the cross, while in S. Mary Pammakaristos and SS. Peter and Mark
it is absent (pp. <a href="#Page_149">149,</a>
<a href="#Page_193">193</a>). But though no longer a structural part of the
church, a gynecaeum appears over the narthex in the latest type of
church (p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>). It is generally vaulted in
three bays, corresponding to the three bays of the narthex below,
and opens by three arches into the centre cross arm of the church
and into the aisles.</p>

<p><i>The Narthex.</i>&mdash;Unlike the gynecaeum, the narthex
tends in later times to become of greater importance, and to add a
narthex was a favourite method of increasing the size of a church.
In basilican churches, like S. John of the Studion, the narthex was
a long hall in three bays annexed to the west side of the building,
and formed the east side of the atrium. In domed cross churches
with galleries the passage under the western gallery was used as a
narthex, being cut <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>off from the central area by the screen
arcade which supported the gallery. Such a narthex has been styled
a 'structural narthex,' as forming an essential part of the central
building. It occurs in several of the churches of the city (p. <a
href="#Page_114">114</a>).</p>

<p>In domed cross churches without galleries, and in churches of
the 'four column' type, neither narthex nor gallery was possible
within the cross, and accordingly the narthex was added to the west
end. It is usually in three bays and opens into the aisles and
central area. Frequently the ends of the narthex terminate in
shallow niches (p. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>). In many churches a
second narthex was added (p. <a href="#Page_166">166</a>) to the
first, sometimes projecting an additional bay at each end, and
communicating with halls or chapels on the north or south, or on
both sides of the church (p. <a href="#Page_128">128</a>). S.
Mark's at Venice presents a fine example of such an extension of
the narthex.</p>

<p>When a church could not be sufficiently enlarged by additional
narthexes, a second church was built alongside the first, and both
churches were joined by a narthex which extended along the front of
the two buildings. S. Mary Panachrantos (p. <a href="#Page_128">
128</a>) is a good example of how a church could be thus enlarged
from a simple square building into a maze of passages and
domes.</p>

<p><i>The Interior.</i>&mdash;The natural division, in height, of
an early church, whether basilican or domical, was into three
stories&mdash;the ground level, the gallery level, and the
clearstory or vault level. In the West these structural divisions
were developed into the triple composition of nave-arcade,
triforium, and clearstory. In the East, in conjunction with the
dome, these divisions survive in many examples of the later period.
Still, Byzantine architecture was more concerned with spaces than
with lines. Large surfaces for marble, painting, or mosaic were of
prime importance, and with the disappearance of the gallery the
string-course marking the level of the gallery also tended to
disappear. In churches with galleries, like S. Theodosia
(<a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>) and S. Mary Diaconissa
(<a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>), the string-courses fulfil their function,
the first marking the gallery level, the second the springing of
the vault. In SS. Peter and Mark (p. <a href="#Page_193">
193</a>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
which has no gallery, there is only one
string-course, corresponding in level to the original gallery
string-course; accordingly the main arches are highly stilted above
it. The absence of the second string-course is a faulty
development, for a string-course at the vault level would be a
functional member, whereas at the gallery level it is
meaningless.</p>

<p>In the Panachrantos (p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>), as well as
in other churches without a gallery, the gallery string-course is
omitted by a more logical development, and the string-course at the
springing of the vault is retained. Openings which do not cut into
the vault are then frankly arched, without impost moulding of any
kind. Simple vaulted halls, narthexes, and passages have usually a
string-course at the vaulting level, broken round shallow pilasters
as at the Chora, S. Theodosia, and the Myrelaion. Sometimes the
string-courses or the pilasters or both are omitted, and their
places are respectively taken by horizontal and vertical bands.
Decorative pilasters flush with the wall are employed in the marble
incrustation of S. Sophia.</p>

<p>In churches of the 'four column' type the full triple division
is common but with a change in purpose. A gallery in a church of
this character is not possible, for the piers between which the
gallery was placed have dwindled into single shafts. Hence the
first string-course ceases to mark a gallery level and becomes the
abacus level of the dome columns, as in the north and in the south
churches of the Pantokrator. It is then carried round the building,
and forms the impost moulding of the side arches in the bema and of
the east window. Sometimes, however, it does not extend round the
bema and apse but is confined to the central part of the church, as
in the Myrelaion, S. Theodore, and the Pantepoptes. On the other
hand, in at least one case, the parecclesion of the Pammakaristos,
the central part of the chapel is designed in the usual three
tiers, but the apse and bema vaults spring from the lower or abacus
string-course, leaving a lunette in the dome arch above pierced by
a large window. A corresponding lunette at the west end opens into
the gynecaeum of the chapel. In S. John in Trullo the two
string-courses coalesce and the arches connecting the columns with
the walls cut into the stilted part of the dome arches, with the
result that all the structural arches and vaults spring from the
same level.</p>

<p><i>Arches.</i>&mdash;Though the pointed arch was known and
employed in cisterns, as in the Cistern of the One Thousand and One
Columns, Bin-bir-derek, the circular arch is invariably found in
work meant to be seen. The difficulty attending this form, in which
arches of unequal breadth do not rise to the same height, was
overcome, as in the West, by stilting, that is, by raising the
smaller arches on straight 'legs' to the required height. The
stilted arch, indeed, seems to have been admired for its own sake,
as we find it used almost universally both in vaulting and in
decorative arches even where it was not structurally required. In
windows and in the arches connecting the dome columns to the wall
stilting is sometimes carried to extremes.</p>

<p><i>Domes.</i>&mdash;The eastern dome of S. Irene, erected about
740 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, is generally considered to be
the first example of a dome built on a high drum, though S. Sophia
of Salonica, an earlier structure, has a low imperfect drum. After
this date the characteristics of the Byzantine dome are the high
drum divided by ribs or hollow segments on the interior, polygonal
on the exterior, and crowned by a cornice which is arched over the
windows.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Drumless domes are sometimes found in the later churches, as in
the narthexes of the Panachrantos and S. Andrew, the angle domes of
S. Theodosia, and in Bogdan Serai. These are ribless hemispherical
domes of the type shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_8">8</a>, and are in
all cases without windows. The earlier system of piercing windows
through the dome does not occur in the later churches, though
characteristic of Turkish work.</p>

<p>The three diagrams (Figs. <a href="#fig_8">8</a>,
<a href="#fig_9">9,</a> and <a href="#fig_10">10</a>) illustrate the
development of the dome: firstly, the low saucer dome or dome-vault
in which dome and pendentives are part of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>same
spherical surface; secondly, the hemispherical dome on pendentives;
and thirdly, the hemispherical dome with a drum interposed between
it and the pendentives.<a name="fig_8" id="fig_8"></a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.&mdash;The
Saucer Dome Or Dome-Vault.</span></p></div>

<p>Flat external cornices on the dome are not uncommon in the later
churches of Byzantine Greece, as in S. Sophia at Monemvasia.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">27</a> In Constantinople only one dome with a flat
cornice can be regarded as original, that of S. John in Trullo, a
church which is exceptional also in other respects. The many other
domes in the churches of Constantinople on high drums and with flat
cornices are Turkish either in whole or in part. The high ribless
domes of the Panachrantos, for instance, circular in plan within
and without, with square-headed windows, plain stone sill, and flat
cornice in moulded plaster, may be regarded as typical Turkish
drum-domes. As will appear in the sequel, the dome over the north
church of the Pantokrator and the domes of SS. Peter and Mark, the
Diaconissa, and S. Theodosia, are also Turkish.<a name="fig_9" id="fig_9"></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
It is most unfortunate that the domes of
these three domed cross churches have been altered, especially as
the domes of S. Mary Diaconissa and S. Theodosia are larger than
any of the later domes except the large oval dome on the central
church of the Pantokrator which is almost of the same size. It is
therefore now difficult to say what was the precise form of the
original domes. Most probably they were polygonal drum-domes, and
their collapse owing to their size may well have led to the small
drum-domes of later times. Though not strictly Byzantine these
Turkish domes are of interest as showing the development of
Byzantine forms under Turkish rule, and that reversion to the
earlier drumless dome which is so marked a feature of the imperial
mosques of the city.<a name="fig_10" id="fig_10"></a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.&mdash;The Drum
Dome.</span></p></div>

<p>Domes are either eight, twelve, or sixteen sided, and usually
have a window in each side. These numbers arise naturally from
setting a window at each of the cardinal points and then placing
one, two, or three windows between, according to the size of the
dome. Internally the compartments are separated by broad, flat
ribs, or are concave and form a series of ridges on the dome which
die out towards the crown. In sixteen-sided domes of the latter
type the alternate sides sometimes correspond to the piers outside,
so that the dome which has sixteen sides within shows only eight
sides without, as in the narthex of S. Theodore (<a href="#Page_246">p. 246</a>). The octagonal dome of the Myrelaion <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
(<a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>) seems to have had only four windows
from the beginning.</p>

<p>The ribs of a Byzantine dome are not constructive in the same
way as are the ribs of a Gothic vault. They were built along with
the rest of the dome and of the same material, and are in no way
separate from the infilling, though they no doubt strengthened the
shell of the dome by their form<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.
On the outside a circular shaft with a very simple cap is often
placed at the angles of the piers, and from these shafts the brick
cornice springs in a series of arches over the windows. Sometimes
the angle is formed by a point between two half-shafts, as in the
domes of the narthex in S. Theodore (p. <a href="#Page_246">
246</a>).</p>

<p><i>External Treatment.</i>&mdash;In the older churches the
exterior seems to have been left in simple masses of brickwork,
impressive only by their size and proportion. Probably even this
effect was not considered of great importance. In later times a
very beautiful system of decoration with slender shallow niches was
introduced and was applied in particular to the east end and to the
apses. The finest examples of this system on a large scale are seen
at the Pantokrator (p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>) and S.
Theodosia (p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>). Carefully considered or
elaborate external compositions are rare, and the only examples in
Constantinople are the side chapel of the Pammakaristos (p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>) and the narthex of S. Theodore
(p. <a href="#Page_246">246</a>).</p>

<p><i>External Marble and Mosaic.</i>&mdash;Marble and mosaic, we
have reason to know, were occasionally used on the exterior of
churches,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> though no fragments remain.
On the south side of the Pantepoptes (p. <a href="#Page_216">216</a>)
the string-course does not correspond to the line of the
walls, but projects in a manner which shows that marble must have
been employed to line the large windows. A similar projection of
the string-course or cornice is not uncommon elsewhere, though not
so evident as in the Pantepoptes, and may have been made to receive
a marble or mosaic lining.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
<i>Doors and Windows.</i>&mdash;It is a
primary rule in Byzantine architecture that all constructive
openings are arched. Whatever may be the eventual form of a door or
window the opening is first built in brick with a semicircular
head, and into this opening the marble jambs and lining are fitted
leaving a semicircular lunette above. Doors are square-headed, with
heavily moulded architraves and cornice, and the lintel is mitred
into the jambs instead of having the more constructive horizontal
joint used in the West.</p>

<p>The doors made of wood or of wood lined with bronze, swing on
top and bottom pivots which turned in bronze-lined sockets in
lintel and threshold. They closed with a rebate in the jambs and
against the raised threshold. Windows were sometimes filled in a
similar manner, as in the palace of the Porphyrogenitus and in the
north gallery of S. Saviour in the Chora
(Fig. <a href="#fig_100">100</a>). In the latter double windows or shutters were employed,
opening inwards in the same way as did the doors. These shutters
may perhaps be regarded as domestic, for in the churches, as is
still seen in S. Sophia though the arrangement has vanished
elsewhere, the entire arched opening was usually filled in with a
pierced marble grille.</p>

<p>In addition to the simple round-headed windows double and triple
windows are found. Double windows were naturally formed by dividing
the single arch by a central pier. This method presented two
varieties: either the pier was continued up to the containing arch,
thus giving two pointed lights, or the two lights were covered by
separate arches within the main arch. Both methods are used in the
narthex of S. Theodore (p. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>). Another
variety was produced by placing two single lights together, with a
shaft between them instead of the central pier. But as double
windows are not very satisfactory, triple windows are more common.
In this case both the methods just described of forming the windows
were adopted. A large semicircular opening divided by two piers
will give an arched light between two pointed lights, or three
arched lights, as in the narthex of S. Theodore. In the former
case, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
shafts are substituted for the piers, a little adjustment will produce
the beautiful form found in the side-chapels of the Pammakaristos
(p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a>),
and of S. Saviour in the Chora (p. <a href="#Page_310">310</a>),
where the two side lights are covered by half-arches whose crowns
abut on the capitals of the shafts, while between and above them
rises the semicircular head of the central light.</p>

<p>The method of grouping three arched windows of the same height
is adopted in apse windows, each of them occupying one side of the
exterior. As the deep, narrow mullions are set radiating, the arch
is narrower inside than outside. But this difficulty was overcome,
partly by lowering the inner crowns, so that the arch is conical,
partly by winding the surface. In the Pantokrator
(<a href="#Page_238">p. 238</a>), instead of radiating to the centre of the
apse, the side and mullions are placed parallel to the axis of the
church, thus obviating all difficulty. Generally the centre to
which the mullions radiate is considerably beyond the apse, so that
any necessary little adjustment of the arch could easily be
made.</p>

<p>Triple windows supported on circular columns are not infrequent
in the north and south cross arms. Sometimes the central light is
larger than the lateral lights, at other times, as in the
Pantepoptes, the three lights are equal. The lower part of these
windows was probably filled in with a breastwork of carved slabs,
as in S. Sophia, while the upper part was filled by a pierced
grille. At present the existing examples of these windows have been
built up to the abaci of the capitals, but in the church of S. Mary
Diaconissa (p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>) the columns still show
the original form on the inside.</p>

<p><i>Vaulting.</i>&mdash;All Byzantine churches of any importance
are vaulted in brick. The only exception to this rule in
Constantinople is the little church known as Monastir Mesjedi
(<a href="#Page_264">p. 264</a>). The different systems of Byzantine
vaulting have been so fully treated by Choisy and other
authorities, that in the absence of any large amount of new
material it is not necessary to give here more than a few notes on
the application of these systems in Constantinople. It should
always be kept in view that, as these vaults were constructed with
the lightest of centering, the surfaces and curves must have been
largely determined by the mason as he built, and would not
necessarily follow any definite geometrical development. "Il serait
illusoire," remarks Choisy, "d'attribuer &agrave; toutes les voutes
byzantines un trace g&eacute;om&eacute;trique rigoureusement
d&eacute;fini."<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>The vaults commonly found are the barrel vault, the
cross-groined vault, and the dome-vault. The first is frequently
used over the cross arms and the bema, and sometimes over the
narthex in conjunction with the groined vault (Diaconissa). It is
the simplest method of covering an oblong space, but it does not
easily admit of side windows above the springing.</p>

<p>A very beautiful form of cross-groined vault is found in S.
Sophia and in SS. Sergius and Bacchus, in which the crown is
considerably domed, and the groins, accordingly, lose themselves in
the vaulting surface. This form is found in Greek churches of late
date, but does not occur in the later churches of Constantinople. A
full description of the form and construction is given by Choisy<a
name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">31</a> and by Lethaby and Swainson.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"
class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>The cross-groined vault as found in the Myrelaion and many other
churches of the city is level in the crown, with clearly marked
groins. It is sometimes used with transverse arches resting on
pilasters, or without these adjuncts.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of the vault forms is the
dome-vault, a shallow dome with continuous pendentives. It is
distinguished in appearance from the groined vault, as found in S.
Sophia, by the absence of any groin line, and is completely
different in construction.</p>

<p>The geometrical construction is that of the pendentives of all
domes. The four supporting arches intersect a hemispherical surface
whose diameter is equal to the diagonal of the supporting square.
The pendentives produce at the crown line of the arches a circular
plan which is filled in by a saucer dome of the same radius as the
pendentives, constructed of circular brick rings, the joints of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
which radiate to the centre. If the space to
be covered is not square the broader arches intersect at a higher
level, while the narrow arches are not stilted, but kept down so as
to receive the dome surface, and in this case the narrow arches are
not semicircular, but segmental. Where the difference in size
between the two sides was not great, the difficulty presented was
easily overcome by the Byzantine builder, who in the later
buildings, at any rate, rarely built anything within four inches of
its geometrical position. Where the difference was too great it was
frankly accepted, and we find segmental arches at the narrow
ends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="fig_11" id="fig_11"></a>
<img src="images/fig_11.png" width="502" height="386"
alt="Fig. 11. Diagram of Vaulting in Outer Narthex of S. Saviour in the Chora." title="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.
11.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The vaulting of the outer narthex of S. Saviour in the Chora
illustrates this fully (Fig. 11). Though some of the bays of that
narthex are oblong and others almost square all are covered with
dome vaults. The almost square bays, although their sides vary
considerably, are covered precisely <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> as if their sides were exactly
equal. But in two of the oblong bays, which are nearly three times
as long as they are broad, such a method could not be applied.
Longitudinal arches (AA) were accordingly thrown between the
transverse arches (CC) and made to rest on their spandrils. The
oblong form of the intervening space was thus very much reduced,
and over it flat domes are thrown. Their rings are true circles,
and as the space they cover is still somewhat oblong they descend
lower, with additional segments of rings (BB), at the ends than at
the sides. In the remaining two oblong bays of the narthex, the
result of introducing the longitudinal arches is to convert a
decidedly oblong space in one direction into a slightly oblong
space in the opposite direction, an additional proof, if any were
needed, that the exact shape of plan with this form of vault was a
matter of comparative indifference to the builder.</p>

<p>In S. Sophia the vault springs from the intrados of the
transverse arches, that is, from the lower edge. In SS. Sergius and
Bacchus it springs from a point so slightly raised as to be hardly
noticeable. In the later vaults, however, the transverse arches,
when present, are boldly shown, and the vault springs from the
extrados or outer edge (<i>e.g.</i> S. Saviour in the Chora, S.
Theodore).</p>

<p><i>Construction.</i>&mdash;Most of the churches of the city are
covered with thick coats of plaster and whitewash, both within and
without. Only in a few cases, where these coatings have fallen away
through neglect, or in some remote corner of a building to which
these coatings were never applied, can the construction and the
laying of the brickwork be studied. The two-storied chapel, known
as Bogdan Serai (p. <a href="#Page_283">283</a>), is almost denuded
of plaster, and is therefore of importance in this connection. The
bricks of the wall arches on which its dome rests are laid
considerably flatter than the true radiating line, leaving a
triangular piece to be filled in at the crown. On the other hand,
the bricks of the transverse arches under the dome radiate to the
centre.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the method followed in the wall arches
was employed in order to economise centering, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> bricks could
gradually be worked out over the space, each course simply sticking
to the one below. This is undoubtedly the case in some examples.
But here centering could not have been of any service in the wall
arches, and the transverse arches are laid without flattening of
the courses, though that arrangement might have been useful in
their case. It is therefore more probable that the flattening of
the courses in the wall arches is simply a piece of careless
workmanship. The pendentives, like all pendentives that could be
examined, were formed of horizontal courses corbelled out to the
circle. The dome, bema, and the barrel vault in the lower story
(<a href="#Page_285">p. 285</a>) seem to be laid with true radiating
joints. The springing of the barrel vault is formed of four courses
of stone laid horizontally and cut to the circle, and above them
the entire barrel is of brick. The dome arches of the Sanjakdar
Mesjedi (p. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>) are formed of three
distinct rings, not bonded into one another. They radiate to the
true centre, and the pendentives are, as usual, in horizontal
courses. The transverse arches of the outer narthex in S. Saviour
in the Chora are also built with true radiating courses.</p>

<p>The gynecaeum of the side-chapel of the Pammakaristos
(<a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>) has never been plastered, and consequently
the laying of the brickwork can be seen there to advantage. The
little stair leading up to the gallery is covered with a sloping
barrel vault built in segments perpendicular to the slope of the
stair and could easily have been built without centering. The same
remark applies to the cross vault at the head of the stair, which
is similarly constructed in 'slices' parallel to each side
(<a href="#Page_154">p. 154</a>). The arches of the gynecaeum itself,
the vaults, and the two little domes, seem to have true radiating
joints. The ribs of the domes are formed in the brickwork, and are
not structurally separate. In these last examples, and in all door
and window openings, in which the joints invariably radiate from
the centre, a certain amount of centering was inevitable.</p>

On the other hand a little passage in S.
Saviour in the Chora between the church and the parecclesion
(<a href="#Page_311">p. 311</a>), is covered with a barrel vault
evidently built without centering. The space is first narrowed by
two corbelled courses of stone and, above them, by three projecting
courses of brick. From this springs the vault, built from each end
in strongly inclined segments. These segments meet in the middle,
leaving a diamond-shaped space filled in with longitudinal courses.
Like the stairs in the Pammakaristos, this passage is very narrow,
some 85 cm., yet the builders thought it necessary to corbel out
five courses before venturing to throw a vault without
centering.</p>

<p>Near the Pantokrator is an octagonal building, now Suleiman Aga
Mesjedi but generally regarded as a Byzantine library, which has on
each side a large wall arch strongly elliptical in form
(<a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>). Two arches of somewhat similar form and
apparently original are found in the south end of the gynecaeum of
the Pantokrator (p. <a href="#Page_237">237</a>). These arches may
have been built in this manner to economise centering. Still, in
the library they are wall arches easily constructed without
centering.</p>

<p>Failing the examination of a larger number of buildings in
Constantinople we can hardly judge of the later methods of vault
and arch construction, but one point may be further noticed. The
wall internally is often set back slightly at each spring course,
so that with the projection of the course a considerable ledge or
shelf is left. On this ledge centering could easily be supported
and would have required no further framework to the ground.
Centering seems to have been used for dorm, arches, vaults, and
door and window openings. It was not used in small vaults. But it
is difficult to imagine any method of constructing such groined
vaults as those found in the narthexes of the Pantokrator without a
very considerable amount of centering.</p>

<p><i>Ties.</i>&mdash;As a general rule tie rods or beams were
used, either of iron or wood. In the latter case they were painted
with leaf or fret ornaments, and were evidently considered as
natural features. But large vaults are often found without <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>such
ties as in the narthex of the Pantokrator. Many churches have ties
to the dome-arches, and none to the main vault; but it is difficult
to lay down a fixed rule. The enormous amount of mortar in the
walls must have made them yield to a certain degree when newly
built, and some of the larger vaults would have been the better for
rods.</p>

<p><i>Abutments.</i>&mdash;The system of abutments in the Byzantine
churches of the great period has been carefully studied by M.
Choisy.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> In early examples the dome
springs directly from the pendentives on the inside, but is
thickened externally over the haunches, producing a double curve
and an apparent drum. This is seen very clearly in SS. Sergius and
Bacchus. In S. Sophia the numerous windows are cut through this
drum, so that it resembles rather a series of small abutments. The
object was to support the crown of the dome by adding weight over
the haunches. In both these churches the thrust of the dome and its
supporting arches is taken by the two-storied galleries, which
form, in fact, flying buttresses within the buildings, and are
adapted to their architectural requirements. The square plan and
the enormous size of the dome in S. Sophia demanded the great
buttresses on the sides; while in SS. Sergius and Bacchus the eight
buttresses show only on the outside of the dome and are not carried
over the aisles as they are in S. Sophia. Below the roof the arches
and piers of the galleries and aisles are arranged so as to carry
the thrust to the external walls, and following the tradition of
Roman vaulting all buttressing is internal. In S. Irene, where the
true drum dome first appears, the buttresses between the windows of
the dome still remain, though much reduced in size. A dome raised
on a drum can evidently no longer exercise a thrust against the
dome-arches; its thrust must be taken by the drum, and only its
weight can rest on the arches.</p>

<p>The weight of the drum and dome rests on the pendentives and
dome-arches. Their thrust is neutralized by the use of ties and by
the barrel vaults of the cross arms, and these in their turn depend
on the thickness of the walls.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
The lower buildings attached to the church in the form of
side-chapels and the narthex also helped to stiffen and buttress
the cross walls. The system is by no means perfect in these late
churches. It was apparently found impossible to construct drum
domes of any size, except at the extreme risk of their falling in,
and probably it is for this reason that many of the larger domes in
late churches, like SS. Peter and Mark, S. Theodosia, the Chora,
have fallen. No system of chainage appears to have been used for
domes in Constantinople.</p>

<p>Flying buttresses probably of the ninth century are used at the
west end of S. Sophia. The double-flying buttress to the apse of
the Chora does not bond with the building and is certainly not
original. It may be set down as part of the Byzantine restoration
of the church in the fourteenth century. In any case, such external
flying abutments are alien to the spirit of Byzantine architecture,
and may be regarded as an importation from the West. Flying
buttresses, it may here be noted, are not uncommon in the great
mosques of the city. They are found in Sultan Bayazid, Rustem
Pasha, Sultan Selim, the Suleimanieh, and the Shahzad&eacute;. But
they are generally trifling in size, and are rather ornaments than
serious attempts to buttress the dome.</p>

<p><i>Walls.</i>&mdash;The walls of the earlier churches are built
of large thin bricks laid with mortar joints at least as thick as
the bricks, and often of greater thickness. Stone is used only in
special cases, as in the main piers of S. Sophia, but monolithic
marble columns are an important part of the structure. In the later
churches stone is used in courses with the bricks to give a banded
effect, and herring-bone, diamond, and radiating patterns are
frequently introduced. The palace of the Porphyrogenitus, the
parecclesion of the Pammakaristos, and Bogdan Serai, exhibit this
style of work. As illustrations of the method adopted in the
construction of walls the following measurements may be given, the
sizes being in centimetres:</p>

<i>Building Procedure.</i>&mdash;The first
step in the erection of a building was to obtain the necessary
marble columns with their capitals and bases. These seem to have
been largely supplied ready made, and Constantinople was a great
centre for the manufacture and export of stock architectural
features. Then the main walls were built in brick, the columns were
inserted as required, the vaults were thrown, and the whole
building was left to settle down. Owing to the enormous amount of
mortar used this settling must have been very considerable, and
explains why hardly a plumb wall exists in Constantinople, and why
so many vaults show a pronounced sinking in at the crown or have
fallen in and have been rebuilt. After the walls had set the marble
facings, mosaic, and colour were applied and could be easily
adapted to the irregular lines of the walls.</p>

<p>Byzantine architecture made little use of mouldings. The great
extension of flat and spacious decoration rendered unnecessary, or
even objectionable, any strong line composition. External cornices
are in coursed brick, the alternate courses being laid diagonally
so as to form the characteristic dentil. The richest form is that
found in the Pammakaristos, S. Theodosia, and S. Thekla, where the
small dentil cornice is supported on long tapering corbels, a
design suggested by military machicolations.</p>

The stone ogee, cavetto, or cavetto and
bead cornice is common, but seems in every case to be Turkish work
and is very common in Turkish buildings. Internal cornices and
string-courses are in marble, and are all of the same type, a splay
and fillet. The splayed face is decorated with upright leaves or
with a guilloche band, either carved (in the Pantepoptes) or
painted (in the Chora), the carving as in classic work, serving
only to emphasise the colour. The splay is sometimes slightly
hollowed, sometimes, as in the Chora, worked to an ogee.</p>

<p><i>Doors.</i>&mdash;Doors often have elaborately moulded
architraves and cornice. In S. John of the Studion
(<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>), the oldest example, the jamb-moulding has a
large half-round on the face, with small ogees and fillets, all on
a somewhat massive scale. The doors of S. Sophia are very similar.
The later mouldings are lighter but the half-round on the face
remains a prominent feature. It is now undercut and reduced in
size, and resembles the Gothic moulding known as the bowtell. This
is combined with series of fillets, small ogees, and cavettos into
jamb-moulds of considerable richness. The cornices are often simply
splayed or are formed of a series of ogees, fillets, and cavettos.
The jamb-mouldings are cut partly on a square and partly on a steep
splayed line. In some, the portion forming the ingo seems to have
been regarded as a separated piece though cut from the solid. If in
the doors of the Pantokrator or the Pantepoptes the line of the
inner jamb be continued through the rebate, it will correspond on
the outside with the bowtell moulding, as though the inner and
outer architrave had been cut from one square-edged block, placing
the bowtell at the angle and adding the rebate. This formation is
not followed in S. John of the Studion.</p>

<p><i>Carving.</i>&mdash;Carving is slight, and is confined to
capitals, string-courses, and the slabs which filled in the lower
parts of screens and windows. Fragments of such slabs are found
everywhere. They are carved with geometrical interlacing and floral
patterns, often encircling a cross or sacred monogram, or with
simply a large cross. Such slabs may be seen still in position in
S. Sophia and in the narthex of S. Theodore. In the latter they are
of verd antique, and are finely carved on both sides. In later
times the embargo<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> on figure sculpture was considerably
relaxed. Little figures are introduced in the cornices of the eikon
frames in the Diaconissa (p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>), and both
in the parecclesion and the outer narthex of the Chora are found
many small busts of angels, saints, and warriors carved with great
delicacy. The carving in the Chora is the finest work of the kind
excepting that in S. Sophia.</p>

<p><i>Capitals.</i>&mdash;The development of the capital from the
Roman form, which was suitable only for the lintel, to the impost
capital shaped to receive an arch has been well explained by
Lethaby and Swainson. According to these authors Byzantine capitals
exhibit seven types.</p>

<p>I. The Impost capital.&mdash;It is found in SS. Sergius and
Bacchus, the outer narthex of the Chora, the inner narthex of S.
Andrew and elsewhere. A modification of this type is used in
windows. It was employed throughout the style but especially in
early times up to the sixth century, and again in the twelfth,
thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<p>II. The Melon type.&mdash;This is seen on the columns of the
lower order in SS. Sergius and Bacchus and on the columns of the
narthex of S. Theodore, where they have been taken from an older
building. The melon capital was probably not in use after the sixth
century.</p>

<p>III. The Bowl capital.&mdash;This type is used in the great
order of S. Sophia at Constantinople. It has been thought peculiar
to this church, but the capitals from S. Stephen at Triglia in
Bithynia resemble those of S. Sophia closely. Only the peculiar
volutes of the S. Sophia capitals are absent.<a name="FNanchor_34"
id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>IV. The Byzantine or 'Pseudo-Ionic.'&mdash;This is found in the
upper order of SS. Sergius and Bacchus, and in the narthex of S.
Andrew. It is an early type, not used after the sixth century, and
its occurrence in S. Andrew favours the early date assigned to that
church.</p>

<p>V. The Bird and Basket.&mdash;Found in Constantinople, only in
S. Sophia.</p>

<p>VI. The Byzantine Corinthian.&mdash;This is the commonest <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>form of
capital in the later churches, and must have been in continuous use
from the earliest date. It occurs in S. John of the Studion, the
Diaconissa, the Chora, and in many other churches. Here the classic
form is accurately adhered to, but, as the curved abacus was
unsuitable to the arch, a large splayed abacus or impost block is
placed above the capital. It is a general feature of the Byzantine
capital that it projects at no point beyond the impost line of the
arch, thus differing both from the classic and the Gothic
forms.</p>

<p>VII. The Windblown Acanthus.&mdash;This is found in the churches
of Salonica and Ravenna. Three examples are mentioned as seen in
Constantinople, two near the Diaconissa, forming bases for the
posts of a wooden porch to a house; one is the cistern commonly
known as the cistern of Pulcheria.</p>

<p><i>Window Capitals.</i>&mdash;In shafted window of several
lights, the impost piers between the arches are of the full
thickness of the wall, but are very narrow from side to side.
Similarly the shafts are almost slabs placed across the wall, and
sometimes, as in the Pammakaristos, are carved on their narrow
faces. The capitals are cubical, of slight projection at the sides,
but spreading widely at the ends, while the bases closely resemble
capitals turned upside down. As with columns, the joints at base
and necking are bedded in sheet lead.</p>

<p><i>Floors.</i>&mdash;The floors are usually of thick red brick
tiles, some .31 cm. square, or, as in S. Theodore, hexagonal, .34
cm. across by 45 cm. from point to point. Marble floors were used
when possible, inlaid with patterns, or in slabs surrounded by
borders of coloured marbles, as is still seen in a portion of the
floor in the Pantokrator (Fig. <a href="#fig_76">76</a>).</p>

<p><i>Decoration.</i>&mdash;Of the churches of Constantinople only
S. Sophia, S. Mary Diaconissa, the South Church of the Pantokrator,
and the Chora, retain any considerable part of their original
decoration. The first is beyond our present scope, but from the
general tone and atmosphere which still linger there we are able to
appreciate the effect of the same style of decoration where it
survives in less complete form.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
The accepted method, as may be observed in
the Chora and the Diaconissa, was to split marble slabs so as to
form patterns in the veining, and then to place them upright on the
wall. It is probable that the finest slabs were first placed in the
centre points of the wall, and that other slabs or borders were
then arranged round them. The centre slabs in the Chora are of
exceptional beauty. The usual design consists of a dado of upright
slabs surmounted by panelling to the cornice level, the panels
being outlined with plain or carved beads. In the Diaconissa the
notched dentil form is used for the beads; in the Chora, a 'bead
and reel.' The arches have radiating voussoirs, or, in the
Diaconissa, a zigzag embattled design, found also in S. Demetrius
of Salonica, though two hundred years must have separated the
buildings. In the Chora the arch spandrils and cornice are inlaid
with scroll and geometrical designs in black, white, and coloured
marbles.</p>

<p>The surfaces above the cornice and the interior of the domes
gleamed with mosaic, representing, as seen in the Chora, figures on
a gold background. The mosaic cubes are small, measuring 5 mm. to 7
mm., and are closely set. This is about the same size as the mosaic
cubes in S. Sophia, but smaller than those at Ravenna, which
measure about 10 mm.</p>

<p><i>Painting.</i>&mdash;In the majority of churches this full
decoration with marble and mosaic must have been rendered
impossible by the expense, and accordingly we find examples like
the parecclesion at the Chora decorated with painting, following
exactly the tradition of marble and mosaic. This painting is in
tempera on the plaster, and is executed with a free and bold
touch.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;Byzantine architecture is essentially
an art of spaces. 'Architectural' forms, as we are accustomed to
think of them, are noticeably absent, but as compensation, colour
was an essential and inseparable part of the architecture. The
builder provided great uninterrupted spaces broken only by such
lines and features as were structurally necessary&mdash;capitals,
columns, string-courses, and over these spaces the artist spread a
glittering robe of marble or mosaic. <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span> No school has ever expressed
its structure more simply, or given fuller scope to the artist,
whether architect or painter.</p>

<p>Byzantine architecture is not only a school of construction, it
is also a school of painting. Most of the churches of
Constantinople have unfortunately lost the latter part of their
personality. They are mere ghosts, their skeletons wrapped in a
shroud of whitewash. Still the Greek artist retained his skill to
the last, and the decorative work of S. Saviour in the Chora will
stand comparison even with the similar work in S. Sophia.</p>

<p>In Byzantine times the greatness of S. Sophia tended to crush
competition. No other ecclesiastical building approached the 'Great
Church.' But structural ability was only latent, and displayed its
old power again in the erection of the imperial mosques of the
early Turkish Sultans, for they too are monuments of Greek
architectural genius.</p>

<p>The origins of Byzantine architecture have been discussed at
great length by Strzygowski, Rivoira, and many other able writers.
Much work still remains to be done in the investigation of the
later Roman and early Byzantine work; nor does it seem probable
that the difficult questions of the Eastern or the Western origin
of Byzantine art will ever be finally settled.</p>

<p>The beginnings of Byzantine architecture have never been
satisfactorily accounted for. With S. Sophia it springs almost at
once into full glory; after S. Sophia comes the long decline. It
may, however, be noted that the 'endings' of Roman architecture are
similarly obscure. Such buildings as the Colosseum, in which the
order is applied to an arched building, are evidently transitional,
the Roman construction and the Greek decoration, though joined, not
being merged into one perfect style. Even in the baths and other
great buildings of Imperial Rome the decoration is still Greek in
form and not yet fully adapted to the arched construction. At
Spalatro, in such parts as the Porta Aurea, a developed style seems
to be on the point of emerging, but it is not too much to say that
in no great Roman building do we find a perfect and homogeneous
style.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
There is nothing in either the planning or
the construction of S. Sophia which cannot be derived from the
buildings of the Roman Imperial period, with the exception of the
pendentive, a feature which had to be evolved before the dome could
be used with freedom on any building plan on a square. The great
brick-concrete vaulted construction is that of the Roman baths, and
with this is united a system of decoration founded on the classic
models, but showing no trace of the Greek beam tradition which had
ruled in Rome.</p>

<p>S. Sophia then may be regarded as the culminating point of one
great Roman-Byzantine school, of which the art of classic Rome
shows the rise, and the later Byzantine art the decline. This view
is in accord with history, for Constantinople was New Rome, and
here, if anywhere, we should expect to find preserved the
traditions of Old Rome.</p>

<p>The division of Western Mediaeval Architecture into the two
schools of Romanesque and Gothic presents a parallel case. It is
now realised that no logical separation can be made between the two
so-called styles. Similarly we may continue to speak of the Classic
Roman style and of the Byzantine style, although the two really
belong to one great era in the history of art.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. JOHN THE BAPTIST OF THE STUDION, EMIR AHOR
JAMISSI</h4>

<p>The mosque Emir Ahor Jamissi, situated in the quarter of
Psamathia, near the modern Greek church of S. Constantine, and at
short distance from the Golden Gate (Yedi Koul&eacute;), is the old
church of S. John the Baptist, which was associated with the
celebrated monastery of Studius, &#7969; &mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Sigma;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;. It
may be reached by taking the train from Sirkiji Iskelessi to
Psamathia or Yedi Koul&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>In favour of the identification of the building, there is,
first, the authority of tradition,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
which in the case of a church so famous may be confidently accepted
as decisive. In the next place, all indications of the character
and position of the Studion, however vague, point to Emir Ahor
Jamissi as the representative of that church. For the mosque
presents the characteristic features which belonged to the Studion
as a basilica of the fifth century, and stands where that sanctuary
stood, in the district at the south-western angle of the city,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">37</a> and on the left hand of the street leading
from S. Mary Peribleptos (Soulou Monastir) to the Golden Gate.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">38</a> Furthermore, as held true of the Studion,
the mosque is in the vicinity of the Golden Gate,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">39</a> and readily <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>accessible from a gate and
landing (Narli Kapou) on the shore of the Sea of Marmora.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"
class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>According to the historian Theophanes,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
the church was erected in the year 463 by the patrician Studius,
after whom the church and the monastery attached to it were named.
He is described as a Roman of noble birth and large means who
devoted his wealth to the service of God,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
and may safely be identified with Studius who held the consulship
in 454 during the reign of Marcian.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>If we may trust the Anonymus,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
the church erected by Studius replaced a sanctuary which stood at
one time, like the Chora, outside the city. Seeing the territory
immediately beyond the Constantinian fortifications was well
peopled before its inclusion within the city limits by Theodosius
II., there is nothing improbable in the existence of such
extra-mural sanctuaries, and as most, if not all, of them would be
small buildings, they would naturally require enlargement or
reconstruction when brought within the wider bounds of the capital.
According to Suidas,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> the building was at
first a parochial church; its attachment to a monastery was an
after-thought of its founder.</p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 36.</i></p>

<p>The monastery was large and richly endowed, capable of
accommodating one thousand monks.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
Its first inmates were taken from a fraternity known as the
Akoimeti, 'the sleepless'; so named because in successive companies
they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>celebrated divine service in their chapels
day and night without ceasing, like the worshippers in the courts
of heaven.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i6">'Even thus of old</span> <span
class="i0">Our ancestors, within the still domain</span> <span
class="i0">Of vast cathedral or conventual church</span> <span
class="i0">Their vigils kept: where tapers day and night</span>
<span class="i0">On the dim altar burned continually.</span> <span

class="i0">When in their land the Almighty's service
ceased.'</span></div>
</div>

<p>But this devout practice does not seem to have been long
continued at the Studion; for we never hear of it in any account of
the discipline of the House. The monks of the Studion should
therefore not be identified with the Akoimeti who took up such a
determined and independent attitude in the theological conflicts
under Zeno, Basiliscus, and Justinian the Great.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47"
class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>In the course of its history the church underwent noteworthy
repairs on two occasions. It was first taken in hand for that
purpose, soon after the middle of the eleventh century,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48"
class="fnanchor">48</a> by the Emperor Isaac Comnenus (1057-58), who was
interested in the House because he and his brother had received
part of their education in that 'illustrious and glorious school of
virtue.'<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> What the repairs then made
exactly involved is unfortunately not stated. But, according to
Scylitzes, they were so extensive that 'to tell in detail what the
emperor and empress did for the embellishment of the church would
surpass the labour of Hercules.'<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
Probably they concerned chiefly the decoration of the edifice.</p>

<p>The next repairs on record were made about the year 1290, in the
reign of Andronicus II., by his unfortunate brother Constantine
Porphyrogenitus. Owing to the neglect <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>of the building during the
Latin occupation the roof had fallen in, the cells of the monks had
disappeared, and sheep grazed undisturbed on the grass which
covered the grounds. Constantine, rich, generous, fond of
popularity, did all in his power to restore the former glory of the
venerated shrine. The new roof was a remarkable piece of work;
large sums were spent upon the proper accommodation of the monks,
and the grounds were enclosed within strong walls.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Like other monastic institutions, the Studion suffered greatly
at the hands of the iconoclast emperors. Under Constantine
Copronymus, indeed, the fraternity was scattered to the winds and
practically suppressed, so that only twelve old members of the
House were able to take advantage of the permission to return to
their former home, upon the first restoration of eikons in 787 by
the Empress Irene. Under these circumstances a company of monks,
with the famous abbot Theodore at their head, were eventually
brought from the monastery of Saccudio to repeople the Studion, and
with their advent in 799 the great era in the history of the House
began, the number of the monks rising to seven hundred, if not one
thousand.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>Theodore had already established a great reputation for sanctity
and moral courage. For when Constantine VI. repudiated the Empress
Maria and married Theodote, one of her maids of honour, Theodore,
though the new empress was his relative, denounced the marriage and
the priest who had celebrated it, insisting that moral principles
should govern the highest and lowest alike, and for this action he
had gladly endured scourging and exile. The Studion had, therefore,
a master who feared the face of no man, and who counted the most
terrible sufferings as the small dust of the balance when weighed
against righteousness, and under him the House became illustrious
for its resistance to the tyranny of the civil power in matters
affecting faith and morals. When the Emperor Nicephorus ordered the
restoration of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the priest who had celebrated the marriage
of Constantine VI. with Theodote, not only did Theodore and his
brother Joseph, bishop of Thessalonica, and their venerable uncle
Plato, endure imprisonment and exile, but every monk in the Studion
defied the emperor. Summoning the fraternity into his presence,
Nicephorus bade all who would obey his order go to the right, and
all who dared to disobey him go to the left. Not a single man went
to the right. Under the very eyes of the despot all went to the
left, and in his wrath Nicephorus broke up the community and
distributed the monks among various monasteries. Upon the accession
of Michael I. the exiled monks and Theodore were allowed indeed to
return to the Studion, peace being restored by the degradation of
the priest who had celebrated the obnoxious marriage. But another
storm darkened the sky, when Leo V., the Armenian, in 813, renewed
the war against eikons. Theodore threw himself into the struggle
with all the force of his being as their defender. He challenged
the right of the imperial power to interfere with religious
questions; he refused to keep silence on the subject; and on Palm
Sunday, in 815, led a procession of his monks carrying eikons in
their hands in triumph round the monastery grounds. Again he was
scourged and banished. But he could not be subdued. By means of a
large and active correspondence he continued an incessant and
powerful agitation against the iconoclasts of the day. Nor would he
come to terms with Michael II., who had married a nun, and who
allowed the use of eikons only outside the capital. So Theodore
retired, apparently a defeated man, to the monastery of Acritas<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"
class="fnanchor">53</a>; and there, 'on Sunday, 11 November 826,
and about noon, feeling his strength fail, he bade them light
candles and sing the 119th psalm, which seems to have been sung at
funerals. At the words: "I will never forget Thy commandments, for
with them Thou hast quickened me," he passed away.' He was buried
on the island of Prinkipo, but eighteen years later, when eikons
were finally restored in the worship of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span> Orthodox
Church, his body was transferred to the Studion, and laid with
great ceremony in the presence of the Empress Theodora beside the
graves of his uncle Plato and his brother Joseph, in sign that
after all he had conquered.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
<i>Tandem hic quiescit.</i></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>His remains were interred at the east end of the southern aisle,
where his uncle Plato and his brother Joseph had been buried before
him, and where Naucratius and Nicholas, his successors as abbots of
the Studion, were laid to rest after him. &pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;

<p>There, in fact, during the recent Russian exploration of the
church, three coffins were discovered: one containing a single
body, another four bodies, and another three bodies. The grave had
evidently been disturbed at some time, for some of the bodies had
no head, and all the coffins lay under the same bed of mortar. No
marks were found by which to identify the persons whose remains
were thus brought to view. But there can be no doubt that five of
the bodies belonged to the five persons mentioned above. To whom
the three other bodies belonged is a matter of pure conjecture.
They might be the remains of three intimate friends of Theodore,
viz. Athanasius, Euthemius, Timotheus, or more probably of the
abbots, Sophronius (851-55), Achilles (858-63), Theodosius
(863-64). Cf. <i>Itin</i>. <i>russes</i>, p. 100.</p>
</div>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to think of Theodore only as a
controversalist and defier of the civil authority. He was a deeply
religious man, a pastor of souls, and he revived the religious and
moral life of men, far and wide, not only in his own day, but long
after his life on earth had closed. He made the Studion the centre
of a great spiritual influence, which never wholly lost the impulse
of his personality or the loftiness of his ideal. The forms of
medi&aelig;val piety have become antiquated, and they were often
empty and vain, but we must not be blind to the fact that they were
frequently filled with a passion for holy living, and gave scope
for the creation of characters which, notwithstanding their
limitations, produced great and good men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span> Speaking of Eastern monks and abbots,
especially during the eighth and ninth centuries, Mr. Finlay, the
historian, justly remarks that 'the manners, the extensive charity,
and the pure morality of these abbots, secured them the love and
admiration of the people, and tended to disseminate a higher
standard of morality than had previously prevailed in
Constantinople. This fact must not be overlooked in estimating the
various causes which led to the regeneration of the Eastern Empire
under the iconoclast emperors. While the Pope winked at the
disorders in the palace of Charlemagne, the monks of the East
prepared the public mind for the dethronement of Constantine VI.
because he obtained an illegal divorce and formed a second
marriage. The corruption of monks and the irregularities prevalent
in the monasteries of the West contrast strongly with the condition
of the Eastern monks.' Certainly to no one is this tribute of
praise due more than to the brotherhood in the monastery of
Studius.</p>

<p>The monks of the Studion, like most Greek monks, lived under the
rules prescribed by S. Basil for the discipline of men who aspired
to reach 'the angelic life.' Theodore, however, quickened the
spirit which found expression in those rules, and while inculcating
asceticism in its extremest form, showed greater consideration for
the weakness of human nature. The penalties he assigned for
transgressions were on the whole less Draconian than those
inflicted before his time.</p>

<p>According to the moral ideal cherished in the monastery, the
true life of man was to regard oneself but dust and ashes, and,
like the angels, to be ever giving God thanks. If a monk repined at
such a lot, he was to castigate himself by eating only dry bread
for a week and performing 500 acts of penance. The prospect of
death was always to be held in view. Often did the corridors of the
monastery resound with the cry, 'We shall die, we shall die!' The
valley of the shadow of death was considered the road to life
eternal. A monk could not call even a needle his own. Nor were the
clothes he wore his personal property. They were from time to time
thrown into a heap with the clothes of the other members of the
House, and every monk then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42"
id="Page_42">42</a></span> took from the pile the garment most
convenient to his hand. Female animals were forbidden the
monastery. A monk was not allowed to kiss his mother, not even at
Easter, under penalty of excommunication for fifty days. Daily he
attended seven services, and had often to keep vigil all night
long. There was only one set meal a day; anything more in the way
of food consisted of the fragments which a monk laid aside from
that meal. No meat was eaten unless by special permission for
reasons of health.</p>

<p>If a brother ate meat without permission he went without fish,
eggs, and cheese for forty days. The ordinary food consisted of
vegetables cooked in oil. Fish, cheese, and eggs were luxuries.
Two, sometimes three, cups of wine were permitted. If a brother was
so unfortunate as to break a dish, he had to stand before the
assembled monks at dinner time with covered head, and hold the
broken article in view of all in the refectory.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> It was forbidden to a monk to feel sad.
Melancholy was a sin, and was to be overcome by prayer, one hundred
and fifty genuflexions, and five hundred Kyrie Eleisons a day. The
monks were required to read regularly in the monastery library.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56"
class="fnanchor">56</a> The task of copying manuscripts occupied a
place of honour, and was under strict regulations. Fifty
genuflexions were the penalty prescribed for not keeping one's copy
clean; one hundred and fifty such acts of penance for omitting an
accent or mark of punctuation; thirty, for losing one's temper and
breaking his pen; fasting on dry bread was the fate of the copyist
guilty of leaving out any part of the original, and three days'
seclusion for daring to trust his memory instead of following
closely the text before him.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>Ignatius of Smolensk<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
found Russian monks in the monastery employed in transcribing books
for circulation in Russia. Stephen of Novgorod<a name="FNanchor_59"
id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
met two old friends from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">43</a></span>his town busy copying the Scriptures. A
good monastic scriptorium rendered an immense service; it did the
work of the printing-press.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding all restrictions, men could be happy at the
Studion. One of its inmates for instance congratulates himself thus
on his lot there, 'No barbarian looks upon my face; no woman hears
my voice. For a thousand years no useless
(&#7940;&pi;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;) man has
entered the monastery of Studius; none of the female sex has
trodden its court. I dwell in a cell that is like a palace; a
garden, an oliveyard, and a vineyard surround me. Before me are
graceful and luxuriant cypress trees. On one hand is the city with
its market-place; on the other, the mother of churches and the
empire of the world.'<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Hymnology was likewise cultivated at the Studion, many hymns of
the Greek Church being composed by Theodore and his brother
Joseph.</p>

<p>Two abbots of the monastery became patriarchs: Antony (975),<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">61</a> and Alexius (1025),<a name="FNanchor_62"
id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
the latter on the occasion when he carried the great relic of the
Studion, the head of John the Baptist, to Basil II. lying at the
point of death.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>At least as early as the reign of Alexius I. Comnenus, the abbot
of the Studion held the first place among his fellow-abbots in the
city. His precedence is distinctly recognised in a Patriarchal Act
of 1381 as a right of old standing.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>The spirit of independence which characterized the monastery did
not die with the abbot Theodore. The monks of the Studion were the
most stubborn opponents of the famous Photius who had been elevated
to the patriarchal throne directly from the ranks of the laity, and
in the course of the conflict between him and the monks during the
first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>tenure of his office for ten years, the
abbots of the House were changed five times. Indeed, when Photius
appointed Santabarenus as the abbot, a man accused of being a
Manichaean, and who professed to be able to communicate with
departed spirits, many of the monks, if not all of them, left their
home. Nor was this the last assertion of the freedom of conscience
for which this monastery was distinguished, and which makes it
memorable in history.</p>

<p>Like other monasteries the Studion often served as a place of
correction for offenders whom it was expedient to render harmless
without recourse to the extreme rigour of the law. Santabarenus,
who has just been mentioned, was sent in his wild youth, after
narrowly escaping a sentence of death at the hands of the Caesar
Bardas, to this monastery in the hope of being reformed in the
orthodox atmosphere of the House. In the reign of Leo VI.
(826-912), an official named Mousikos was sent hither to be cured
of the propensity to accept bribes.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> In
912, Gregoras and Choirosphacta were obliged to join the
brotherhood to repent at leisure for having favoured the attempt of
Constantine Ducas, domestic of the Scholae, to usurp the throne of
Constantine VII. Porphyrogenitus when seven years of age.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>Several emperors sought the shelter of the Studion as a refuge
from danger, or as a retreat from the vanity of the world. Thither,
in 1041, Michael V. and his uncle Constantine fled from the popular
fury excited by their deposition of the Empress Zoe and the
slaughter of three thousand persons in the defence of the palace.
The two fugitives made for the monastery by boat, and betook
themselves to the church for sanctuary. But as soon as the place of
their concealment became known, an angry crowd forced a way into
the building to wreak vengeance upon them, and created a scene of
which Psellus has left us a graphic account. Upon hearing the news
of what was going on, he and an officer of the imperial guard
mounted horse and galloped to the Studion. A fierce mob was madly
attempting to pull down the structure, and it was with the utmost
difficulty that the two friends managed to enter the church and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
make their way to the altar. The building seemed full of wild
animals, glaring with eyes on fire at their victims, and making the
air resound with the most terrible cries. Michael was on his knees
clasping the holy table; Constantine stood on the right; both were
dressed like monks, and their features were so transformed by
terror as to be almost beyond recognition. The spectacle of
greatness thus brought low was so pathetic that Psellus burst into
tears and sobbed aloud. But the crowd only grew more fierce, and
drew nearer and nearer to the fugitives as though to rend them in
pieces. Only a superstitious dread restrained it from laying hands
upon them in a shrine so sacred and venerated. The uproar lasted
for hours, the mob content meanwhile with striking terror and
making flight impossible. At length, late in the afternoon, the
prefect of the city appeared upon the scene, accompanied by
soldiers and followed by large crowds of citizens. He came with
instructions to bring Michael and Constantine out of the church. In
vain did he try the effect of mild words and promises of a gentle
fate. The fallen emperor and his uncle clung to the altar more
desperately. The prefect then gave orders that the two wretched men
should be dragged forth by main force. They gripped the altar yet
more tightly, and in piteous tones invoked the aid of all the
eikons in the building. The scene became so heartrending that most
of the spectators interfered on behalf of the victims of
misfortune, and only by giving solemn assurance that they would not
be put to death was the prefect allowed to proceed to their arrest.
Michael and Constantine were then dragged by the feet as far as the
Sigma, above S. Mary Peribleptos (Soulou Monastir), and after
having their eyes burnt out were banished to different monasteries,
to muse on the vanity of human greatness and repent of their
misdeeds.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>The Studion appears in the final rupture of the Eastern and
Western Churches.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The immediate occasion
was a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>letter sent by the Archbishop of Achrida, in
1053, to the Bishop of Trani, condemning the Church of Rome for the
use of unleavened bread in the administration of the Holy
Communion, and for allowing a fast on Saturday. Nicetas Stethetos
(Pectoratus), a member of the House renowned for his asceticism,
and for his courage in reproving the scandalous connection of
Constantine IX. with Sklerena, wrote a pamphlet, in Latin, in
which, in addition to the charges against Rome made by the
Archbishop of Achrida, the enforced celibacy of the clergy was
denounced. The pamphlet was widely circulated by the Patriarch
Kerularios, who wished to bring the dispute between the Churches to
an issue. But the emperor not being prepared to go so far, invited
the Pope to send three legates to Constantinople to settle the
differences which disturbed the Christian world. Cardinal Humbert,
one of the legates, replied to Nicetas in the most violent language
of theological controversy, and to bring matters to a conclusion an
assembly, which was attended by the Emperor Constantine, his court,
and the Papal legates, met at the Studion on the 24th of June 1054.
A Greek translation of the pamphlet composed by Nicetas was then
read, and after the discussion of the subject, Nicetas retracted
his charges and condemned all opponents of the Roman Church. His
pamphlet was, moreover, thrown into the fire by the emperor's
orders, and on the following day he called upon the Papal legates,
who were lodged at the palace of the Peg&eacute; (Baloukli), and
was received into the communion of the Church he had lately
denounced. But the patriarch was not so fickle or pliant. He would
not yield an iota, and on the 15th of July 1054 Cardinal Humbert
laid on the altar of S. Sophia the bull of excommunication against
Kerularios and all his followers, which has kept Western and
Eastern Christendom divided to this day.</p>

<p>When Michael VII. (1067-78) saw that the tide of popular feeling
had turned against him in favour of Nicephorus Botoniates, he
meekly retired to this House, declining to purchase a crown with
cruelty by calling upon the Varangian guards to defend his throne
with their battle-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>axes. Michael was appointed bishop of
Ephesus, but after paying one visit to his diocese he returned to
Constantinople and took up his abode in the monastery of Manuel(<a href="#Page_257">p. 257</a>).<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>To the Studion, where he had studied in his youth and which he
had embellished, the Emperor Isaac Comnenus retired, when pleurisy
and the injuries he received while boar-hunting made him realize
that he had but a short time to live. In fact, he survived his
abdication for one year only, but during that period he proved a
most exemplary monk, showing the greatest deference to his abbot,
and besides performing other lowly duties acted as keeper of the
monastery gate. How thoroughly he was reconciled to the exchange of
a throne for a cell appears in the remark made to his wife, who had
meantime taken the veil at the Myrelaion, 'Acknowledge that when I
gave you the crown I made you a slave, and that when I took it away
I set you free.' His widow commemorated his death annually at the
Studion, and on the last occasion surprised the abbot by making a
double offering, saying, 'I may not live another year,' a
presentiment which proved true. According to her dying request,
Aecatherina was buried in the cemetery of the Studion, 'as a simple
nun, without any sign to indicate that she was born a Bulgarian
princess and had been a Roman empress.'<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>On the occasion of the triumphal entry of Michael Palaeologus
into the city in 1261, the emperor followed the eikon of the
Theotokos Hodegetria, to whom the recovery of the Empire was
attributed, on foot as far as the Studion; and there, having placed
the eikon in the church, he mounted horse to proceed to S.
Sophia.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>One of the sons of Sultan Bajazet was buried at the Studion.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72"
class="fnanchor">72</a> The prince had been sent by the Sultan as a
hostage to the Byzantine Court, and being very young attended
school in Constantinople with John, the son of the Emperor Manuel.
There he acquired a taste for Greek letters, and became a convert
to the Christian faith; but for fear of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>Sultan's
displeasure he was long refused permission to be baptized. Only
when the young man lay at the point of death, in 1417, a victim to
the plague raging in the city, was the rite administered, his
schoolmate and friend acting as sponsor.</p>

<p>A tombstone from the cemetery of the monastery is built into the
Turkish wall at the north-eastern corner of the church. It bears an
epitaph to the following effect:&mdash;'In the month of September
of the year 1387, fell asleep the servant of God, Dionysius the
Russian, on the sixth day of the month.' The patrician Bonus, who
defended the city against the Avars in 627, while the Emperor
Heraclius was absent dealing with the Persians, was buried at the
Studion.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>On the festival of the Decapitation of S. John the Baptist, the
emperor attended service at the Studion in great state. Early in
the morning the members of the senate assembled therefore at the
monastery, while dignitaries of an inferior rank took their place
outside the gate (Narli Kapou) in the city walls below the
monastery, and at the pier at the foot of the steep path that
descends from that gate to the shore of the Sea of Marmora, all
awaiting the arrival of the imperial barge from the Great Palace.
Both sides of the path were lined by monks of the House, holding
lighted tapers, and as soon as the emperor disembarked, the
officials at the pier and the crowd of monks, with the abbot at
their head, swinging his silver censer of fragrant smoke, led the
way up to the gate. There a halt was made for the magistri,
patricians, and omphikialioi
(&#8000;&mu;&phi;&iota;&kappa;&iota;&#8049;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&iota;)
to do homage to the sovereign and join the procession, and then the
long train wended its way through the open grounds attached to the
monastery (&delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7952;&xi;&alpha;&#8051;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;), and through
covered passages (&delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#8182;&nu;
&#7952;&kappa;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigma;&epsilon;
&delta;&iota;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8182;&nu;),<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">74</a> until it reached the south-eastern end of
the narthex
(&epsilon;&#7984;&sigma;&#8051;&rho;&chi;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
&delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;

&mu;&#8051;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&nu;&#8049;&rho;&theta;&eta;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;). Before the
entrance at that point, the emperor put on richly embroidered
robes, lighted tapers, and then followed the clergy into the
church, to take his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> stand at the east end of the south aisle.
The most important act he performed during the service was to
incense the head of John the Baptist enshrined on the right hand of
the bema. At the conclusion of the Office of the day, he was served
by the monks with refreshments under the shade of the trees in the
monastery grounds
(&#7936;&nu;&alpha;&delta;&epsilon;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#8049;&delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;);
and, after a short rest, proceeded to his barge with the same
ceremonial as attended his arrival, and returned to the palace.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a>

<p>The church was converted into a mosque in the reign of Bajazet
II. (1481-1512) by the Sultan's equerry, after whom it is now
named.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The church of S. John the Baptist of the Studion is a basilica,
and is of special interest because the only surviving example of
that type in Constantinople, built while the basilica was the
dominant form of ecclesiastical architecture in the Christian
world. It has suffered severely since the Turkish conquest,
especially from the fire which, in 1782, devastated the quarter in
which it stands, and from the fall of its roof, a few winters ago,
under an unusual weight of snow. Still, what of it remains and the
descriptions of its earlier state given by Gyllius, Gerlach, and
other visitors, enable us to form a fair idea of its original
appearance. The recent explorations conducted by the Russian
Institute at Constantinople have also added much to our knowledge
of the building.</p>

<p>It is the oldest church fabric in the city, and within its
precincts we stand amid the surroundings of early Christian
congregations. For, partly in original forms, partly in imitations,
we still find here a basilica's characteristic features: <i>the
atrium</i>, or quadrangular court before the church; on three of
its sides surrounded by <i>cloisters</i>; in its centre, the marble
<i>phial&eacute;</i> or fountain, for the purification of the
gathering worshippers; the <i>narthex</i>, a pillared porch along
the western fa&ccedil;ade, where catechumens and penitents,
unworthy to enter <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>the sanctuary itself, stood afar off; the
interior area divided into <i>nave</i> and <i>aisles</i> by lines
of columns; the semicircular <i>apse</i> at the eastern extremity
of the nave for altar and clergy; and <i>galleries</i> on the other
sides of the building to provide ample accommodation for large
assemblies of faithful people.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Gyllius (<i>De Top. Constant.</i> l. iv. c. 9) describes the
church as follows: 'Quod (monasterium) nunc non extat; aedes extat,
translata in religionem Mametanam; in cujus vestibulo sunt quatuor
columnae cum trabeatione egregie elaborata; in interiore parte
aedium utrinque columnae sunt septem virides, nigris maculis velut
fragmentis alterius generis lapidum insertis distinctae, quarum
perimeter est sex pedum et sex digitorum. Denique earum ratio
capitulorum, epistyliorum opere Corinthio elaborata, eadem est quae
columnarum vestibuli. Supra illas sex existunt totidem columnae in
parte aedis superiore. In area aedis Studianae est cisterna, cujus
lateritias cameras sustinent viginti tres columnae excelsae
Corinthiae.'</p>

<p>Gerlach (<i>Tagebuch</i>, p. 217; cf. pp. 359, 406) describes it
under the style of the church of S. Theodore, for he confounds the
monastery of Studius with that of the Peribleptos at Soulou
Monastir: 'Das ist eine sehr hohe und weite Kirche (wie die
unsern); hat zwei Reyhen Marmel-steiner S&auml;ulen mit
Corinthischen Kn&auml;ufen (capitellis), auff einer jeden Seiten
sieben; auff deren jeden wieder ein andere S&auml;ule stehet. Der
Boden ist mit lauter buntem von V&ouml;geln und anderen Thieren
gezierten Marmel auff das sch&ouml;nste gepfl&auml;stert.' (This is
a very lofty and broad church (like our churches). It has two rows
of marble columns with Corinthian capitals, on either side seven;
over each of which stands again another column. The floor is paved
in the most beautiful fashion entirely with variegated marble,
adorned with figures of birds and other animals.)</p>

<p>Choiseul Gouffier (<i>Voyage pittoresque en Gr&egrave;ce</i>,
ii. p. 477), French ambassador to the Sublime Porte (1779-92),
speaks of the church in the following terms: 'Dans
l'int&eacute;rieur sont de chaque c&ocirc;t&eacute; sept colonnes
de vert antique, surmont&eacute;es d'une frise de marbre blanc
parfaitement sculpt&eacute;e, qui contient un ordre plus petit et
tr&egrave;s bien proportionn&eacute; avec le premier. Je ne sais de
quel marbre sont ces secondes colonnes, parce que les Turcs qui
d&eacute;figurent tout ont imagin&eacute; de les couvrir de
chaux.'</p>

<p>Ph. Bruun (<i>Constantinople, ses sanctuaires et ses reliques au
commencement du XV^e si&egrave;cle</i>, Odessa, 1883) identifies
with the Studion one of the churches dedicated to S. John, which
Ruy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>Gonzalez de Clavijo visited in
Constantinople when on his way to the Court of Tamerlane. But that
church was 'a round church without corners,' 'una quadra redonda
sin esquinas,' and had forty-eight columns of verd antique, 'veinte
&eacute; quatro marmoles de jaspe verde, ... &eacute; otros veinte
&eacute; quatro marmoles de jaspe verde.' What church the Spanish
ambassador had in view, if his description is correct, it is
impossible to say. No other writer describes such a church in
Constantinople. See the <a href="#note">Note</a> at the end of this
chapter for the full text of the ambassador's description.</p>
</div>

<p>The northern wall of the atrium is original, as the crosses in
brick formed in its brickwork show. The trees which shade the
court, the Turkish tombstones beneath them, and the fountain in the
centre, combine to form a very beautiful approach to the church,
and reproduce the general features and atmosphere of its earlier
days.</p>

<p>The narthex is divided into three bays, separated by heavy
arches. It is covered by a modern wooden roof, but shows no signs
of ever having been vaulted. The centre bay contains in its
external wall a beautiful colonnade of four marble columns,
disposed, to use a classical term, 'in antis.' They stand on
comparatively poor bases, but their Corinthian capitals are
exceptionally fine, showing the richest Byzantine form of that type
of capital. The little birds under the angles of the abaci should
not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The entablature above the columns, with its architrave, frieze,
and cornice, follows the classic form very closely, and is enriched
in every member. Particularly interesting are the birds, the
crosses, and other figures in the spaces between the modillions and
the heavy scroll of the frieze. The drill has been very freely used
throughout, and gives a pleasant sparkle to the work.</p>

<p>In the second and fourth intercolumniations there are doorways
with moulded jambs, lintels, and cornices, but only the upper parts
of these doorways are now left open to serve as windows.</p>

<p>The cornice of the entablature returns westwards at its northern
and southern ends, indicating that a colonnade, with a smaller
cornice, ran along the northern and southern sides of the atrium,
if not also along its western side. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> cloisters behind the
colonnades, were connected at their west end with the narthex by
two large and elaborately moulded doorways still in position.</p>

<p>Five doors lead from the narthex into the church; three opening
into the nave, the others into the aisles.</p>

<p>The interior of the church, now almost a total ruin, was divided
into nave and two aisles by colonnades of seven columns of verd
antique marble. But only six of the original columns have survived
the injuries which the building has sustained; the other columns
are Turkish, and are constructed of wood with painted plaster
covering.</p>

<p>The colonnades supported an entablature of late Corinthian type,
which, as the fall of the Turkish plaster that once covered it has
revealed, had the same moulding as the entablature in the narthex.
The architrave was in three faces, with a small bead ornament to
the upper two, and finished above with a small projecting moulding.
The frieze was an ogee, bellied in the lower part. Of the cornice
only the bed mould, carved with a leaf and tongue, remains.</p>

<p>Above each colonnade stood another range of seven<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> columns connected, probably, by arches. Along the
northern, southern, and western sides of the church were galleries
constructed of wood. Those to the north and south still exist in a
ruined condition, and many of the stone corbels which supported the
beams remain in the walls. Only scanty vestiges of the gallery
above the narthex can be now distinguished. Its western wall, the
original outer wall of the upper part of the church, has totally
disappeared. Its eastern arcade has been replaced by the Turkish
wall which constitutes the present outer wall of that part of the
church. But beyond either end of that wall are visible, though
built up, the old openings by which the gallery communicated with
its companion galleries; while to the west of the wall project the
ragged ends of the Byzantine walls which formed the gallery's
northern and southern sides. The nave rose probably to a greater
height than it does now, and had a roof at a higher level <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span> than
the roofing of the aisles. It doubtless resembled the basilican
churches at Salonica, either with clearstory windows, as in S.
Demetrius, or without such windows, as in Eski Juma Jamissi.</p>

<p>The nave terminates in a large apse, semicircular within and
showing three sides on the exterior. Only the lower part is
original; the Turkish superstructure is lower and on a smaller
scale than the Byzantine portion it has replaced. There are no side
chapels. Under the bema the Russian explorers discovered a small
cruciform crypt. The large quantity of mosaic cubes found in the
church during the recent Russian excavations proves that the church
was decorated with mosaics, while the remains of iron plugs in the
western wall for holding marble slabs show that the building had
the customary marble revetment. But what is curious is to find the
mortar pressed over the face of the stones, and broad decorative
joints formed by ruled incised lines and colour. Mr. W. S. George
suggests that this was a temporary decoration executed pending some
delay in the covering of the walls with marble. He also thinks that
the importance given to the joint in late Byzantine work and in
Turkish work may be a development from such early treatment of
mortar.</p>

<p>The floor of the church was paved with pieces of marble arranged
in beautiful patterns, in which figures of animals and scenes from
classic mythology were inlaid. Gerlach<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
noticed the beauty of the pavement, and Salzenberg<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> represents a portion of it in his work on S.
Sophia. But the members of the Russian Institute of Constantinople
have had the good fortune to bring the whole pavement to light.</p>

<p>A noticeable feature is the number of doors to the church, as in
S. Irene. Besides the five doors already mentioned, leading into
the interior from the narthex, there is a door at the eastern end
of each aisle, and close to each of these doors is found both in
the southern and northern walls of the building an additional door
surmounted by a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>window. The latter doors and their windows
have been walled up.</p>

<p>The exterior is in two stories, corresponding to the ground
floor and the galleries. It has two ranges of eight large
semicircular-headed windows in the northern and southern walls,
some of them modified, others built up, since the building became a
mosque. The five windows in the gable of the western wall are, like
the wall itself, Turkish. Pilasters are placed at the angles and at
the apse.</p>

<p>On the south side of the church is a cistern, the roof of which
rests on twenty-three columns crowned by beautiful Corinthian
capitals.</p>

<p>With the kind help of Professor Cossio of Madrid, the Spanish
text may be roughly translated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>And the first part (door?) of the church is very lofty and
richly worked. And before this door is a large court beside the
body of the church; and the said body is a round hall without
corners (or angles), very lofty, and enclosed round about by three
large naves, which are covered, they and the hall, by one roof. And
it (the church) has in it seven altars; and the roof of the hall
and naves and the walls are of mosaic work very richly wrought, in
which are (depicted) many histories. And the (roof of the) hall is
placed on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> twenty-four marble columns of green jasper
(verd antique). And the said naves have galleries, and the
galleries open on the body of the church, and these have other
twenty-four marble columns of green jasper; and the roof of the
hall and the walls are of mosaic work. And the elevated walks of
the naves open over the body of the church,<a name="FNanchor_80"
id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
and where a balustrade should be found there are small marble
columns of jasper.</p>

<p>Outside the church, adds the ambassador, was a beautiful chapel
dedicated to S. Mary, remarkable for its mosaics.<br />

In the recent excavations carried on in the Studion by the Russian
Archaeological Institute of Constantinople, the foundations of an
earlier building were discovered below the floor of the church. The
line of the foundations ran through the church from north-east to
south-west, parallel to the wall of the cistern to the south-west
of the church. Perhaps it is too soon to determine the character of
the earlier building.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF SS. SERGIUS AND BACCHUS, KUTCHUK AYA SOFIA</h4>

<p>On the level tract beside the Sea of Marmora, to the south of
the Hippodrome, and a few paces to the north-west of Tchatlady
Kapou, stands the ancient church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus. It is
commonly known as the mosque Kutchuk Aya Sofia, Little S. Sophia,
to denote at once its likeness and its unlikeness to the great
church of that name. It can be reached by either of the two streets
descending from the Hippodrome to the sea, or by taking train to
Koum Kapou, and then walking eastwards for a short distance along
the railroad.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt in regard to its identity. For the
inscription on the entablature of the lower colonnade in the church
proclaims the building to be a sanctuary erected by the Emperor
Justinian and his Empress Theodora to the honour of the martyr
Sergius. The building stands, moreover, as SS. Sergius and Bacchus
stood, close to the site of the palace and the harbour of
Hormisdas.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> When Gyllius visited the
city the Greek community still spoke of the building as the church
of SS. Sergius and Bacchus&mdash;'Templum Sergii et Bacchi adhuc
superest, cujus nomen duntaxat Graeci etiam nunc retinent.'<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 63.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>The foundations of the church were laid in 527, the year of
Justinian's accession,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> and its erection must
have been completed before 536, since it is mentioned in the
proceedings of the Synod held at Constantinople in that year.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"
class="fnanchor">84</a> According to the Anonymus, indeed, the
church and the neighbouring church of SS. Peter and Paul were
founded after the massacre in the Hippodrome which suppressed the
Nika Riot. But the Anonymus is not a reliable historian.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>The church did not stand alone. Beside it and united with it,
Justinian built also a church dedicated to the Apostles Peter and
Paul,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> so that the two buildings
formed a double sanctuary, having a common court and a continuous
narthex. They were equal in size and in the richness of the
materials employed in their construction, and together formed one
of the chief ornaments of the palace and the city. There was,
however, one striking difference between them; SS. Sergius and
Bacchus was a domical church, while SS. Peter and Paul was a
basilica. Styles of ecclesiastical architecture destined soon to
blend together in the grandeur and beauty of S. Sophia were here
seen converging towards the point of their union, like two streams
about to mingle their waters in a common tide. A similar
combination of these styles occurs at Kalat-Sem&acirc;n in the
church of S. Symeon Stylites, erected towards the end of the fifth
century, where four basilicas forming the arms of a cross are built
on four sides of an octagonal court.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>The saints to whom the church was dedicated were brother
officers in the Roman army, who suffered death in the reign of
Maximianus,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> and Justinian's particular
veneration for them was due, it is said, to their interposition in
his behalf at a critical moment in his career. Having been
implicated, along with his uncle, afterwards Justin I., in a plot
against the Emperor Anastasius, he lay under sentence of death for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>high treason; but on the eve of his
execution, a formidable figure, as some authorities maintain,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89"
class="fnanchor">89</a> or as others affirm, the saints Sergius and
Bacchus, appeared to the sovereign in a vision and commanded him to
spare the conspirators. Thus Justinian lived to reach the throne,
and when the full significance of his preservation from death
became clear in the lustre of the imperial diadem, he made his
deliverers the object of his devout regard. Indeed, in his devotion
to them he erected other sanctuaries to their honour also in other
places of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Still this church,
founded early in his reign, situated beside his residence while
heir-apparent, and at the gates of the Great Palace, and withal a
gem of art, must be considered as Justinian's special thankoffering
for his crown.</p>

<p>With the church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus was associated a
large monastery known, after the locality in which it stood, as the
monastery of Hormisdas, &#7952;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;
&#8009;&rho;&mu;&#8055;&sigma;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;. It was
richly endowed by Justinian.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>There is some obscurity in regard to the church of SS. Peter and
Paul. According to Theophanes,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
the first church in Constantinople built in honour of those
apostles was built at the suggestion of a Roman senator Festus, who
on visiting the eastern capital, in 499, was astonished to find no
sanctuary there dedicated to saints so eminent in Christian
history, and so highly venerated by the Church of the West. As
appears from a letter addressed in 519 to Pope Hormisdas by the
papal representative at the court of Constantinople, a church of
that dedication had been recently erected by Justinian while
holding the office of Comes Domesticorum under his uncle Justin I.
'Your son,' says the writer, 'the magnificent Justinian, acting as
becomes his faith, has erected a basilica of the Holy Apostles, in
which he wishes relics of the martyr <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>S. Laurentius should be
placed.' 'Filius vester magnificus vir Justinianus, res
convenientes fidei suae faciens, basilicam sanctorum Apostolorum in
qua desiderat Sancti Laurentii martyris reliquias esse,
constituit.'<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> We have also a letter to the
Pope from Justinian himself, in which the writer, in order to
glorify the basilica which he had built in honour of the apostles
in his palace, begs for some links of the chains which had bound
the apostles Peter and Paul, and for a portion of the gridiron upon
which S. Laurentius was burnt to death.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
The request was readily granted in the same year.</p>

<p>The description of the basilica, as situated in the palace then
occupied by Justinian, leaves no room for doubt that the sanctuary
to which the letters just quoted refer was the church of SS. Peter
and Paul which Procopius describes as near
(&pi;&alpha;&rho;&#8049;) the palace of Hormisdas. In that case the
church of SS. Peter and Paul was built before the church of SS.
Sergius and Bacchus, for the inscription on the entablature in the
latter church, not to mention Cedrenus, distinctly assigns the
building to the time when Justinian and Theodora occupied the
throne. This agrees with the fact that Procopius<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> records the foundation of SS. Peter and Paul
before that of SS. Sergius and Bacchus, and if this were all he did
the matter would be clear. But, unfortunately, this is not all
Procopius has done. For after recording the erection of SS. Sergius
and Bacchus, he proceeds to say that Justinian subsequently
(&#7956;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&alpha;) joined another
(&#7940;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;) church,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> a
basilica, to the sanctuary dedicated to those martyrs, thus leaving
upon the reader's mind the impression that the basilica was a later
construction. To whom that basilica was consecrated Procopius does
not say. Was that basilica the church of SS. Peter and Paul which
Procopius mentioned before recording the erection of SS. Sergius
and Bacchus? Is he speaking of two or of three churches? The reply
to this question must take into account two facts as beyond
dispute: first, that the church of SS. Peter and Paul, as the
letters cited above make clear, was earlier than the church of SS.
Sergius and Bacchus; secondly, that the basilica united to the
latter sanctuary was dedicated to the two great apostles; for
scenes which, according to one authority,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
occurred in S. Peter's took place, according to another
authority,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> in the church of SS. Sergius
and Bacchus. In the face of these facts, Procopius is either
mistaken in regard to the relative age of the two sanctuaries, or
he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>has not expressed his meaning as clearly as
he might have done. To suppose that two sanctuaries dedicated to
the great apostles were built by Justinian within a short time of
each other in the same district, one within the palace, the other
outside the palace, is a very improbable hypothesis. The question
on which side of SS. Sergius and Bacchus the basilica of SS. Peter
and Paul stood, seems decided by the fact that there is more room
for a second building on the north than on the south of Kutchuk
Agia Sofia. Furthermore, there are traces of openings in the north
wall of the church which could serve as means of communication
between the two adjoining buildings. Ebersolt, however, places SS.
Peter and Paul on the south side of SS. Sergius and Bacchus.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99"
class="fnanchor">99</a></p>
</div>

<p>A remarkable scene was witnessed in the church in the course of
the controversy which raged around the writings known in
ecclesiastical history as 'The Three Chapters,' the work of three
theologians tainted, it was alleged, with the heretical opinions of
Nestorius. Justinian associated himself with the party which
condemned those writings, and prevailed upon the majority of the
bishops in the East to subscribe the imperial decree to that
effect. But Vigilius, the Pope of the day, and the bishops in the
West, dissented from that judgment, because the authors of the
writings in question had been acquitted from the charge of heresy
by the Council of Chalcedon. To condemn them after that acquittal
was to censure the Council and reflect upon its authority. Under
these circumstances Justinian summoned Vigilius to Constantinople
in the hope of winning him over by the blandishments or the terrors
of the court of New Rome. Vigilius reached the city on the 25th of
January 547, and was detained in the East for seven years in
connection with the settlement of the dispute. He found to his cost
that to decide an intricate theological question, and above all to
assert 'the authority of S. Peter vested in him' against an
imperious sovereign and the jealousy of Eastern Christendom, was no
slight undertaking. Pope and Emperor soon came into violent
collision, and fearing the consequences Vigilius sought sanctuary
in the church of S. Peter<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>
as he styles it, but which Byzantine writers<a name="FNanchor_101"
id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> who record the scene name S. Sergius.</p>

<p>Justinian was not the man to stand the affront. He ordered the
praetor of the city to arrest the Pope and conduct him to prison.
But when that officer appeared, Vigilius grasped the pillars of the
altar and refused to surrender. Thereupon the praetor ordered his
men to drag the Pope out by main force. Seizing Vigilius by his
feet, holding him by his beard and the hair of his head, the men
pulled with all their might, but they had to deal with a powerful
man, and he clung fast to the altar with an iron grip. In this
tug-of-war the altar at length came crashing to the ground, the
Pope's strong hands still holding it tight. At this point, however,
the indignation and sympathy of the spectators could not be
restrained; the assailants of the prostrate prelate were put to
flight, and he was left master of the situation. Next day a
deputation, including Belisarius and Justin, the heir-apparent,
waited upon Vigilius, and in the emperor's name assured him that
resistance to the imperial will was useless, while compliance with
it would save him from further ill-treatment. Yielding to the
counsels of prudence, the Pope returned to the palace of
Placidia,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> the residence assigned to
him during his stay in the capital.</p>

<p>Probably at this time arose the custom of placing the churches
of SS. Peter and Paul, and SS. Sergius and Bacchus at the service
of the Latin clergy in Constantinople, especially when a
representative of the Pope, or the Pope himself, visited the city.
The fact that the church was dedicated to apostles closely
associated with Rome and held in highest honour there, would make
it a sanctuary peculiarly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">68</a></span>acceptable to clergy from Western Europe.
This, however, did not confer upon Roman priests an exclusive right
to the use of the building, and the custom of allowing them to
officiate there was often more conspicuous in the breach than in
the observance. Still the Roman See always claimed the use of the
church, for in the letter addressed in 880 by Pope Julius VIII. to
Basil I., that emperor is thanked for permitting Roman clergy to
officiate again in SS. Sergius and Bacchus according to ancient
custom: 'monasterium Sancti Sergii intra vestram regiam urbem
constitutum, quod sancta Romana Ecclesia jure proprio quondam
retinuit, divina inspiratione repleti pro honore Principis
Apostolorum nostro praesulatui reddidistis.'<a name="FNanchor_103"
id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>The most distinguished hegoumenos of the monastery was John
Hylilas, better known, on account of his learning, as the
Grammarian, and nicknamed Lecanomantis, the Basin-Diviner, because
versed in the art of divination by means of a basin of polished
brass. He belonged to a noble family of Armenian extraction, and
became prominent during the reigns of Leo V., Michael II., and
Theophilus as a determined iconoclast. His enemies styled him
Jannes, after one of the magicians who withstood Moses, to denote
his character as a sorcerer and an opponent of the truth. Having
occasion, when conducting service in the imperial chapel to read
the lesson in which the prophet Isaiah taunts idolaters with the
question, 'To whom then will ye liken God, or to what likeness will
ye compare him?' John, it is said, turned to Leo V., and whispered
the significant comment, 'Hearest thou, my lord, the words of the
prophet? They give thee counsel.' He was a member of the Commission
charged by that emperor to collect passages from the Holy
Scriptures and the Fathers of the Church that condemned the use of
images in worship. Prominent iconodules were interned in the
monastery of Hormisdas in the hope that he would turn them from the
error of their ways by his arguments and influence. He directed the
education of Theophilus and supported the iconoclastic policy
pursued by that pupil when upon the throne.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Theophilus appointed his tutor syncellus to the Patriarch
Antony, employed him in diplomatic missions,<a name="FNanchor_104"
id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> and finally, upon the death of Antony, created
him patriarch. The name of John can still be deciphered under
somewhat curious circumstances, in the litany which is inscribed on
the bronze doors of the Beautiful Gate at the south end of the
inner narthex of S. Sophia. When those doors were set up in 838,
Theophilus and his empress had no son, and accordingly, in the
threefold prayer inscribed upon the doors, the name of John was
associated with the names of the sovereigns as a mark of gratitude
and esteem. But in the course of time a little prince, to be known
in history as Michael III., was born and proclaimed the colleague
of his parents. It then became necessary to insert the name of the
imperial infant in the litany graven on the Beautiful Gate of the
Great Church, and to indicate the date of his accession. To add
another name to the list of names already there was, however,
impossible for lack of room; nor, even had there been room, could
the name of an emperor follow that of a subject, though that
subject was a patriarch. The only way out of the difficulty,
therefore, was to erase John's name, and to substitute the name of
the little prince with the date of his coming to the throne; the
lesser light must pale before the greater. This was done, but the
bronze proved too stubborn to yield completely to the wishes of
courtiers, and underneath Michael's name has kept fast hold of the
name John to this day. The original date on the gate also remains
in spite of the attempt to obliterate it.</p>

<p>SS. Sergius and Bacchus was one of the sanctuaries of the city
to which the emperor paid an annual visit in state.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Upon his arrival at the church he proceeded to
the gallery and lighted tapers at an oratory which stood in the
western part of the gallery, immediately above the Royal Gates, or
principal entrance to the church. He went next to the chapel
dedicated to the Theotokos, also in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>gallery, and after
attending to his private devotions there, took his place in the
parakypticon (&#7952;&nu; &tau;&#8183;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8183;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&theta;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&rho;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;),
at the north-eastern or south-eastern end of the gallery, whence he
could overlook the bema and follow the public service at the
altar.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> In due course the
Communion elements were brought and administered to him in the
chapel of the Theotokos; he then retired to the metatorion (a
portion of the gallery screened off with curtains), while the
members of his suite also partook of the Communion in that chapel.
At the close of the service he and his guests partook of some light
refreshments, biscuits and wine, in a part of the gallery fitted up
for that purpose, and thereafter returned to the palace.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>In the description of the architectural features of the church
and for the plans and most of the illustrations in this chapter I
am under deep obligation to Mr. A. E. Henderson, F.S.A. The
information gained from him in my frequent visits to the church in
his company, and from his masterly article on the church which
appeared in the <i>Builder</i> of January 1906, has been
invaluable.</p>

<p>In design the church is an octagonal building roofed with a dome
and enclosed by a rectangle, with a narthex along the west side.
This was a favourite type of ecclesiastical architecture, and is
seen also in another church of the same period, San Vitale of
Ravenna, in which Justinian and Theodora were interested. There,
however, the octagonal interior is placed within an octagonal
enclosure. The adoption of a rectangular exterior in the
Constantinopolitan sanctuary is a characteristic Byzantine
feature.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> S. Vitale was founded in
526, a year before SS. Sergius and Bacchus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>As an examination of the plan will show, the architect's design
has not been followed with strict accuracy, and the result is that
both the enclosing square and the interior octagon are very
irregular figures. Furthermore, the two portions of the building
have not the same orientation, so that the octagon stands askew
within its rectangular frame. How this lack of symmetry should be
explained, whether due to sloven work or the result of the effort
to adapt the church to the lines of the earlier church of SS. Peter
and Paul, with which it was united, is difficult to decide.</p>

<p>The court which stands before the Turkish portico in front of
the west side of the building represents the old atrium of the
church, and to the rear of the portico is still found the ancient
narthex. At the south end of the narthex is a stone staircase
leading to the gallery. The arch at the foot of the staircase is
built of fragments from the old ciborium or eikonostasis of the
church. The great height (0.24 metre or 9 inches) of the steps is
found, according to Mr. Antoniadi, also in S. Sophia.</p>

<p>The exterior walls, which are mostly in brick and rubble
masonry, exhibit poor workmanship, and have undergone considerable
repair, especially on the east. On the south there are two
thicknesses of walling. The outer thickness has arched recesses at
intervals along its length, corresponding to openings in the inner
thickness, and thus while buttressing the latter also enlarges
slightly the area of the church. The length of the rectangular
enclosure from west to east is 101 feet, with an average breadth of
77<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet from north to south, excluding the recesses in the
latter direction.</p>

<p>All the windows of the church have been altered by Turkish
hands, and are rectangular instead of showing semicircular
heads.</p>

<p>The passage intervening between the rectangular enclosure and
the octagon is divided into two stories, thus providing the church
with an ambulatory below and a gallery above.</p>

<p>The domed octagon which forms the core of the building stands at
a distance of some 18<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet from the rectangle within which
it is placed. It measures 53<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet by 50<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet. The
eight piers at its angles rise to a height of 33<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> from
the floor to the springing of the dome arches. The archways thus
formed, except the bema arch, are filled in with two pairs of
columns in two stories set on the outer plane of the piers. The
lower colonnade is surmounted, after the classic fashion, by a
horizontal entablature profusely carved while the upper columns are
bound by arches, thus making seven sides of the octagon a beautiful
open screen of fourteen columns and as many triple arcades,
resplendent with marbles of various hues and rich with carved work.
The mass of the piers is relieved by their polygonal form, a fluted
cymatium along their summit, and a repeating design of a flower
between two broad leaves below the entablature. Though the flower
points upwards it has been mistaken for a cluster of grapes.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">108</a> At the four diagonal points the sides of
the octagon are semicircular, forming exhedrae, an arrangement
which gives variety to the lines of the figure, widens the central
area, secures more frontage for the gallery, and helps to buttress
the dome. The same feature appears in S. Sophia, whereas in San
Vitale all the sides of the octagon, excepting the eastern side,
are semicircular. The extension of the interior area of a building
(square or octagonal) by means of niches at the angles or in the
sides, or both at the angles and in the sides, was a common
practice.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>There is considerable difference in the size of the piers and
the dome arches. The eastern piers stand farther apart than their
companions, and consequently the arch over them, the triumphal arch
of the sanctuary, is wider and loftier than the other arches. The
bays to the north-east and the south-east are also wider than the
bays at the opposite angles. The apse is semicircular within, and
shows three sides on the exterior. As in S. Sophia and S. Irene,
there is no prothesis or diaconicon.</p>

<p>The pairs of columns, both below and above, are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>alternately
verd antique and red Synnada marble, resting on bases of the
blue-veined white marble from the island of Marmora. The capitals
on the lower order are of the beautiful type known as the 'melon
capital,' a form found also in San Vitale at Ravenna and in the
porch of S. Theodore in Constantinople (p. <a href="#Page_246">
246</a>). The neckings are worked with the capitals, and enriched
by 'egg-and-dart' pointing upwards. In the centre of the capitals
was carved the monogram of Justinian or that of Theodora. Most of
the monograms have been effaced, but the name of the empress still
appears on the capital of the western column in the south bay,
while that of Justinian is found on the first capital in the
south-western bay; on both capitals in the north-western bay,
accompanied by the title Basileus; and, partially, on the last
capital in the north-eastern bay.</p>

<p>In the soffit of the architrave are sunk panels of various
patterns, the six-armed cross occurring twice. The beadings of the
fasciae are enriched with the designs commonly known as 'rope,'
'bead-and-reel,' 'egg-and-dart,' and again 'bead-and-reel.'</p>

<p>The frieze is in two heights. The lower portion is a
semicircular pulvinar adorned with acanthus leaves, deeply
undercut; the upper portion is occupied by a long inscription in
raised ornamental letters to the honour of Justinian, Theodora, and
S. Sergius. The cornice is decorated with dentils, 'bead-and-reel,'
projecting consols, 'egg-and-dart,' and leaves of acanthus.</p>

<p>The inscription (Fig. <a href="#fig_20">20</a>) may be rendered
thus: Other sovereigns, indeed, have honoured dead men whose labour
was useless. But our sceptred Justinian, fostering piety, honours
with a splendid abode the servant of Christ, Creator of all things,
Sergius; whom nor the burning breath of fire, nor the sword, nor
other constraints of trials disturbed; but who endured for the sake
of God Christ to be slain, gaining by his blood heaven as his home.
May he in all things guard the rule of the ever-vigilant sovereign,
and increase the power of the God-crowned Theodora whose mind is
bright with piety, whose toil ever is unsparing efforts to nourish
the destitute.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span> The inscription is not mere flattery to the
founders of the church. Justinian and Theodora were devout after
the fashion of their day, and took a deep interest in the poor. The
empress erected an asylum for fallen women, hostels for strangers,
hospitals for the sick, and homes for the destitute. 'On the
splendid piece of tapestry embroidered in gold which formed the
altar cloth of S. Sophia, she was represented with Justinian as
visiting hospitals and churches.'<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>To the rear of the southern straight side of the octagon two

Justinian, Basileus.</p>

<p>Two feet above the cornice, or twenty feet from the floor of the
church, the level of the gallery is reached.<a name="FNanchor_111"
id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Here the columns are smaller than those below,
and are bound together by arches instead of by an architrave. Their
capitals represent the type known as the 'Pseudo-Ionic' or cushion
capital, in view of its broad head. It appears appropriately here
as the form of capital required to carry the impost of an arch upon
a capital. At one time, indeed, that demand was met by placing upon
the capital a distinct block of stone, a fragment, so to speak, of
the horizontal architrave. It is the device adopted in San Vitale
at Ravenna, S. Demetrius of Salonica, and elsewhere, but never it
would seem in Constantinople, except in the underground cisterns of
the city. It was, however, too inartistic to endure, and eventually
was superseded by capitals with a broad flattened head on which the
wide impost of an arch could rest securely.<a name="FNanchor_112"
id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>A free form of acanthus, deeply undercut on the face towards the
central area of the church, covers the capitals, and in the centre
of that face, on all the capitals except the eighth (counting from
the north-east) is carved the monogram of the title Basileus, or of
Justinian, or of Theodora.</p>

<p>In the south side of the gallery stand two columns corresponding
to the two columns in the aisle below. They are poor in design and
not original. The western capital is 'Pseudo-Ionic,'<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> with a plain cross on the northern face. The
eastern capital is in the basket form with roundels on the four
faces. Two additional columns are found in the western portion of
the gallery. They are of verd antique and larger than the other
columns in this story of the church, and have sunk crosses in them.
The splendour of the interior decoration has certainly been dimmed,
for the walls of the edifice once gleamed with marbles and
glittered with mosaics. 'By the sheen of its <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>marbles,'
says Procopius,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> 'it was more
resplendent than the sun, and everywhere it was filled profusely
with gold.' When Ferguson examined the building, remains of
frescoes or of mosaics, which have disappeared since his time,
could be distinguished in the narthex. The soffit, both of the
upper and of the lower cymatium on the piers, projects sufficiently
to admit the application of the customary marble incrustation. The
proportions of the building are marred by the boarded floor which
rises seventeen centimeters above the original pavement, disguising
the real elevation of the dome and of the columns in the lower
colonnade. But notwithstanding all changes for the worse the
building is still a beautiful structure. Very effective especially
is the happy combination of the various lines and forms here
brought together&mdash;the rectilinear and the semicircular sides
of the octagon, the octagonal fabric and the round dome that crowns
it, the horizontal entablature stretched along the summit of the
lower story of columns and the arches that leap from column to
column in the gallery. This harmonious variety of form has also a
historical significance. An old order in architecture and a new
order here meet and embrace before the earlier, having served its
age, passes away and the later comes triumphant to fill another era
of the world with fresh beauties. Here in the tide of time we look
before and after.</p>

<p>To the student of architecture the dome of this church is
specially interesting. In the application of the dome to the
octagon no pendentives are employed. The octagon is carried up to
the base of the dome, which is built in sixteen longitudinal
compartments that impinge upon one another and form groins giving
to the dome its strength and sweep. On the groins is a plaster
moulding, probably Byzantine. The eight compartments directly above
the dome arches are flat, and flush with the inner face of the
octagon, and in each of them is a semicircular-headed window. They
rise perpendicular to a point a little above the windows, and then
curve with a radius to the centre of the dome.</p>

<p>On the other hand the eight compartments directly above the
angles of the octagon are narrower than the preceding compartments;
they have no windows, and, what is of special importance to note,
they are deeply concave.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
Such marked hollowness is found in later domes as a decorative
feature, but here it is primarily and supremely a constructive
device. By its means the concave compartments are set slightly back
from the octagon's inner face, leaving, at the springing line,
portions of the wall-head to appear as little flat ledges on each
side of the angles. This is a most skilful expedient, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>and compares
favourably with the methods employed elsewhere to apply the dome to
the octagon.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> In the octagonal church of
S. Lorenzo at Milan the octagon is turned into the circle by the
introduction of squinches. In San Vitale a considerable walling is
built between the line of the octagon and the springing line of the
dome, while the bed for the dome is formed by introducing, in the
space over the angles of the octagon, niches which are worked above
to the circle on plan. On the other hand, it is interesting to
compare with these methods the method employed in the baptistery of
S. Sophia, now a Sultan's Turb&eacute;, near the southern entrance
to the inner narthex. Although the walls of the building describe a
square on the exterior, they form an octagon on the interior with
semicircular bays at the diagonals, as in SS. Sergius and Bacchus.
But in the application of the dome the true pendentive is used. The
baptistery was erected shortly before S. Sophia, and in view of the
erection of the great church.</p>

<p>The curvature of the dome of SS. Sergius and Bacchus has three
zones, which have respectively a radius of m. 8, (drawn from the
centre of the octagon), m. 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, and m. 9<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, (centre about m. 2,
below the springing of the dome). The first extends to a point a
little above the heads of the dome windows; the second about m. 2
higher; the third to the crown of the dome. The groins stop short a
little below the dome's apex, where they are arched into one
another, leaving a saucer-shaped crown now capped by a Turkish
finial. The dome is covered with lead, and presents an undulating
surface owing to the protuberance of its eight concave
compartments.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>The system of weighting and buttressing the
dome displays great skill, and will be best understood by studying
Mr. Henderson's geometrical and constructive sections of the
systems (Figs. <a href="#fig_28">28,</a> <a href="#fig_28">29</a>).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. IRENE</h4>

<p>The church of S. Irene stands at a short distance to the
north-east of S. Sophia, in the first court of the Seraglio. Its
identity has never been questioned, for the building was too much
in the public eye and too near the centre of the ecclesiastical
affairs of the city to render possible any mistake concerning its
real character. It is always described as close to S. Sophia.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118"
class="fnanchor">118</a> According to the historian Socrates,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119"
class="fnanchor">119</a> it was originally one of the Christian
sanctuaries of the old town of Byzantium, a statement we may well
believe, seeing Byzantium was the seat of a bishop before the
foundation of Constantinople. The designation of the church as 'the
Ancient' or 'the Old Church,' Ecclesia Antiqua, &#7969;
&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&#8049;,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>
and the special regard cherished for the church during the earlier
history of the city, are also thus best explained. The original
sanctuary was small,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> but when Byzantium
became the capital of the East the old fabric was enlarged and
beautified by Constantine the Great to harmonize with its grander
surroundings, and was dedicated to Peace, in honour of the rest and
quiet which settled upon the Roman world when the founder of the
city had vanquished all his rivals after eighteen years of civil
war.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>Until the year 360, when the church of S. Sophia was opened to
public worship by the Emperor Constantius, S. Irene appears to have
been the cathedral of the city. Hence, probably, the name sometimes
given to it, the Patriarchate, &#964;&#8056;
&pi;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&alpha;&rho;&chi;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">123</a> Nor did the church lose its primacy
altogether even after the erection of S. Sophia. On the contrary,
the two churches were regarded as forming one sanctuary; they were
enclosed within the same court, served by the same clergy, and
known by the same name, 'the Great Church,' &#7969;
&Mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#8049;&lambda;&eta;
&#7960;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> S. Irene was again the sole cathedral building,
while S. Sophia lay in ruins for eleven years after being set on
fire in 404, on the occasion of the final banishment of John
Chrysostom.</p>

<p>S. Irene comes prominently into view during the fierce struggle
between the adherents of the Nicene Creed and the Arians, in the
half-century which followed the inauguration of New Rome. Having
been persuaded that the point at issue between the two theological
parties was not essential, and that the agitation of the question
was due to love of disputation, Constantine the Great, who valued
peace at almost any price, attempted to suppress the controversy by
his authority, and accordingly ordered the Patriarch Alexander to
admit Arius, then present in the city, to the Holy Communion. With
this order Alexander, a champion of the Nicene Creed, refused to
comply. Whereupon the followers of Arius decided to have recourse
to violence. But on the very eve of the day fixed to carry out
their purpose, Arius was taken suddenly ill in the Forum of
Constantine <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>and died on the spot. The historian Socrates
regards the event as the act of God, for when the patriarch heard
what the heretics intended to do, he retired to the church of S.
Irene, and there for many days and nights, with fasting and tears,
and with his lips pressed to the altar, implored divine succour in
his terrible extremity. 'If the opinions of Arius be true,' the
patriarch prayed, 'let me die; but if they are false let him be
judged.' The tragic end of Arius was considered the answer to that
prayer.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Alexander in 343, at the age of ninety-eight,
the two parties came into collision in regard to the question of
his successor. The deceased prelate had recommended two persons as
suitable to fill his place: the presbyter Paul, because of his
abilities; the deacon Macedonius, on account of his age and
venerable appearance. The Arians favoured Macedonius, as more in
sympathy with their opinions; the orthodox, however, carried the
election and installed Paul in S. Irene. The defeated party seems
to have submitted, but the Emperor Constantius, a violent Arian,
quashed the election, and appointed Eusebius of Nicomedia, a
prominent upholder of the views of Arius, bishop of the capital.
Upon the death of Eusebius in 346 the theological combatants again
seized the opportunity to try their strength. The orthodox recalled
Paul; the Arians consecrated Macedonius. Incensed by these
proceedings, Constantius, then at Antioch, ordered Hermogenes, the
magister militum in Thrace, to proceed to Constantinople and drive
Paul from the city. But no sooner did Hermogenes attempt to execute
his instructions than the populace rose, burnt his house to the
ground, and after dragging him along the streets, killed him. The
emperor was furious. He hurried back to Constantinople, banished
Paul, and reduced by one-half the amount of free bread daily
distributed among the citizens. Nor did he fully recognize
Macedonius as bishop. Under these circumstances Paul made his way
to Rome, and, having secured the support of the Pope, reappeared in
Constantinople as the rightful bishop of the see. But the emperor,
again in Syria, was not to be baffled. More angry than ever, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>sent peremptory orders to Philip, the
prefect of Constantinople, to expel Paul and to recognize
Macedonius. By skilful arrangements Paul was quietly removed from
the scene. But to install Macedonius was a more difficult
undertaking. The prefect, however, ordered his chariot, and with
Macedonius seated by his side made for S. Irene, under an escort of
troops carrying drawn swords. The sharp, naked weapons alarmed the
crowds in the streets, and without distinction of sect or class men
rushed for the church, everybody trying to outstrip his neighbour
in the race to get there first. Soon all the approaches to the
building were packed to suffocation; no one stirred backwards or
forwards, and the prefect's chariot was unable to advance. What
seemed a hostile barricade of human beings welded together
obstructed his path. In vain did the soldiers brandish their swords
in the hope of frightening the crowd to disperse. The crowd stood
stock still, not because it would not, but because it could not
move. The soldiers grew angry, resorted to their weapons, and cut a
way to the church through that compact mass of humanity at the cost
of 3150 lives; some of the victims being crushed to death, others
killed at the point of the sword. So was Macedonius conducted to
his throne in the temple of Peace.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
But the conflict between the opposite parties continued, and after
six years spent in efforts to recover his position, Paul was
restored to office through the intervention of the Pope of Rome, of
the Emperor Constans, and of the Synod of Sardica. It was a brief
triumph. In 350 Paul was exiled for life to Cucusus, and Macedonius
ruled once more in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
For the next thirty years S. Irene with the other churches of the
capital remained in the hands of the Arians.</p>

<p>During that period the Nicene faith was preached by Gregory of
Nazianzus only in a small chapel, subsequently dedicated to S.
Anastasia.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> But with the accession of
Theodosius the Great the adherents of the Creed of Nicaea
prevailed, and the Second General Council, held in Constantinople
in 381, adopted that creed as the true faith of the Christian
Church.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>According to the biographer of S. Stephen the Younger, who
enumerates the six ecumenical councils, and indicates, in most
cases, where each met, that famous Council met in the church of S.
Irene.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> But Theodore Lector<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">129</a> says the Council assembled in the church
of Homonoia, and explains the name of that church as commemorative
of the harmony which prevailed among the bishops who gathered there
on that occasion. As a matter of fact, one of the churches of the
city bore the name Homonoia.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
Possibly the discrepancy between the statements of the authors just
mentioned may be due to a confusion arising from a similar meaning
of the names of the two churches.</p>

<p>According to the Anonymus,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
the usurper Basiliscus took refuge with his wife and children in S.
Irene, when he was overthrown in 477, and the Emperor Zeno
recovered the throne. But, according to the <i>Paschal
Chronicle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Basiliscus fled on that
occasion to the great baptistery of S. Sophia. As that baptistery
stood between S. Irene and S. Sophia and may have served both
churches, the difference between the two statements is not
serious.</p>

<p>After standing for two centuries the Constantinian edifice was
burnt to the ground by the fire which the rebel factions in the
Nika Riot set to the offices of the prefect on Friday, the 16th of
January 532. The building had narrowly escaped the same fate in the
fire which destroyed S. Sophia earlier in the course of the riot,
and might have survived also the conflagration in which it actually
perished, but for the strong wind which carried the flames from the
praetorium to the church, devouring on their way the bath of
Alexander, a part of the hospice of Eubulus, and the hospital of
Sampson with its patients.</p>

<p>The restoration of the church was included in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>magnificent
scheme of Justinian the Great to build on the wilderness of ashes
created by his rebel subjects the finest monuments of his empire.
And so S. Irene rose from its ruins, the largest sanctuary in
Constantinople, except S. Sophia.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
The bricks bearing the mark 'the Great Church,'
&Mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#8049;&lambda;&eta;
&#7960;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;, which are
built into a raised bank against the northern wall of the atrium,
afford no indication of the date when S. Irene was rebuilt. The
bank is of comparatively recent origin.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>In the month of December 564, the thirty-seventh year of
Justinian's reign, another great fire threatened to destroy the
buildings which that emperor had erected in the quarter of the city
beside S. Sophia. The hospital of Sampson was again burnt down; the
atrium of the Great Church, known as the Garsonostasion, suffered;
two monasteries close to S. Irene perished, and, what most concerns
us, the atrium and part of the narthex of S. Irene itself were
consumed.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> How soon these injuries
were repaired is not recorded.</p>

<p>During the 176 years that followed the reconstruction of the
church by Justinian, S. Irene does not appear in history. But in
740 it was injured by the earthquake which shook Constantinople in
the last year of the reign of Leo III. the Isaurian.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Theophanes<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
is very precise in regard to the time when the disaster occurred;
it was on the 26th of October, the ninth indiction, on a Wednesday,
at eight o'clock. The damage done both in the city and in the towns
of Thrace and Bithynia was terrible. In Nicaea only one church was
left standing, while Constantinople deplored the ruin of large
portions of the landward fortifications and the loss of many
churches, monasteries, and public monuments. S. Irene was then
shaken, and, as the examination of the building by Mr. George has
proved, sustained most serious injuries. The Emperor Leo died about
six months after the disaster, and it is therefore uncertain
whether the church was rebuilt before his death. His first
attention was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>naturally directed to the reconstruction of
the fortifications of the city, where his name still appears, with
that of his son and successor Constantine Copronymus, as the
rebuilder of the fallen bulwarks. But although there is no record
of the precise date at which the ruined church was repaired, we may
safely assume that if the work was not commenced while Leo III. sat
upon the throne, it was undertaken soon after the accession of
Constantine Copronymus. S. Irene was too important to be long
neglected, and was probably rebuilt during the ascendancy of the
iconoclasts.</p>

<p>The church reappears for a moment in 857 during the dispute
which raged around the persons of Ignatius and Photius as to which
of them was the lawful patriarch. While the partisans of the latter
met in the church of the Holy Apostles to depose Ignatius, the few
bishops who upheld the claims of Ignatius assembled in S. Irene to
condemn and depose Photius with equal vehemence.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>The church comes into view once more in connection with the
settlement of the quarrel caused in 907 by the fourth marriage of
Leo VI. the Wise. As the union was uncanonical, the Patriarch
Nicholas deposed the priest who had celebrated the marriage; he,
moreover, refused the Communion to the emperor, and treated Zoe,
the emperor's fourth wife, as an outcast. For such conduct Nicholas
lost his office, and a more pliant ecclesiastic was appointed in
his place. The inevitable result followed. The religious world was
torn by a schism which disturbed Church and State for fifteen
years. At length Romanus I. summoned a council of divines to
compose the agitation, and peace was restored in 921, by a decree
which condemned a fourth marriage, but allowed a third marriage
under very strict limitations. So important was this decision
regarded that it was read annually, in July, from the pulpit, and
on that occasion the emperor, with the patriarch, attended service
in S. Irene, and at its close took part in a procession from S.
Irene to S. Sophia, on the way back to the Great Palace.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>On Good Friday the patriarch held a service for catechumens
(&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8053;&chi;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;) in S.
Irene, which the patricians were required to attend.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>The church of S. Irene has never been used as a mosque. After
its enclosure within the precincts of the Seraglio soon after the
Turkish conquest, it was converted into an armoury, probably
because it stood in the court occupied by the body of Janissaries
who formed the palace guard, and it has served that military
purpose, in contradiction to its name, for the most part ever
since. For several years it contained the first collection of
antiquities made by the Turkish Government, and some of the objects
in that collection still remain to recall the use of the building
as a museum; the most interesting of them being the chain stretched
across the mouth of the Golden Horn during the siege of 1453, the
monument to the charioteer Porphyrios, and the pedestal of the
silver statue of the Empress Eudocia, which played a fatal part in
the relations of that empress to the great bishop of
Constantinople, John Chrysostom. Since the establishment of the
constitutional r&eacute;gime in the Ottoman Empire the building has
been turned into a Museum of Arms.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>Until the recent establishment of constitutional government in
Turkey it was impossible to obtain permission to study this church
in a satisfactory manner, so jealously was even entrance into the
building guarded. The nearest approach to anything like a proper
examination of the building was when Salzenberg was allowed to
visit the church in 1848, while the church of S. Sophia was
undergoing repairs under the superintendence of the Italian
architect Fossati. But the liberty accorded to Salzenberg was not
complete, and, consequently, his plan of the church published <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>in his
<i>Altchristliche Baudenkm&auml;ler von Konstantinopel</i> is
marred by serious mistakes. Happily the new Government of the
Empire is animated by an enlightened and liberal spirit, and at the
request of His Excellency Sir Gerard Lowther, H.B.M. Ambassador to
the Sublime Porte, permission was granted to the Byzantine Research
and Publication Fund to have the church examined as thoroughly as
its condition allowed, and to make all the plans, drawings, and
photographs required in the interests of a scientific knowledge of
its architectural character. The Byzantine Research and Publication
Fund was fortunate in having as its president, Edwin Freshfield,
LL.D., so long distinguished for his devotion to Byzantine
archaeology, and it is mainly due to his generosity that the means
necessary for carrying on the study of the church were provided.
The society was, moreover, most happy in being able to secure the
services of an architect in Mr. W. S. George, who already possessed
considerable experience in the investigation of Byzantine buildings
at Salonica and elsewhere. Fortunately, also, the building was at
the same time placed under repair, in view of its conversion into a
museum of arms, thus affording exceptional facilities for the
erection of scaffolding and the removal of plaster and other
obstructions. Mr. George gave nearly five months to the study of
the church, and the results of his careful investigations will
appear in a monograph to be published by the Byzantine Research and
Publication Fund. But with great courtesy, in view of the fact that
I was engaged on the present work, and also because I waived my own
application for leave to study S. Irene in favour of the
application made by the Byzantine Fund, I have been allowed to
anticipate that monograph by making use of some of the results of
Mr. George's investigations. For this permission I am very
grateful, as it will add much to the value of this volume. I
visited the church frequently while Mr. George was at work upon it,
and my account of its architectural features is based entirely upon
the information he then kindly supplied, and upon the notes he has
communicated to me since his return to England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>The architectural feature which gives to this building a
peculiar interest, in the study of the development of planning and
construction, is the more complete fusion of the basilican type of
plan with a domical system of roofing which it presents than is
found in any other example of a similar combination.</p>

<p>On the west, where the ground retains its original level, stands
the old atrium, though much modified by Turkish repairs and
alterations. It had covered arcades on the north, south, and west
sides, but only the outer walls of the northern and southern
arcades, with some portions of their inner walls, and three
complete vaulted bays at the northern end of the western arcade,
are Byzantine. The walls, vaults, and piers in other parts of the
arcades are Turkish. There is no trace of the west door which,
under ordinary circumstances, would form the main entrance to the
atrium, but a Byzantine doorway, now built up, is found close to
the narthex, in the outer wall of the south arcade. The area of the
atrium has been, moreover, greatly reduced by the erection, on its
four sides, of an inner range of Turkish vaulting.</p>

<p>Five doors led from the atrium to the narthex, but only the
central and the northernmost of these doors are now open, the
latter entrance still retaining its original architrave and cornice
of white marble, with the usual mouldings and a cross worked on the
crowning member of the cornice. The present entrance to the church,
however, is on the north side of the building, through a porch that
leads down a sloping Turkish passage to the western end of the
north aisle.</p>

<p>The narthex is in five bays, the two terminal bays having
cross-groined vaults, the three central, vaults of a domical
character with blunt rounded groins at the springing. The whole
vaulting surface of the narthex was once covered with mosaics
exhibiting mainly a geometrical pattern.</p>

<p>From the narthex three tall arched openings conducted to the
nave, and one opening to each aisle. But the direct communication
between the narthex and the northern aisle is now cut off by the
insertion of the Turkish entrance to the church, although the old
doorway to the aisle remains complete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>The nave is divided into two large bays of
equal breadth but unequal length, the western bay being the
shorter. In the latter the arches which support its roof are, to
the east and west, semicircular, while those to north and south are
roughly elliptical, springing from the same level and rising to the
same height as the semicircular arches, but being of shorter span.
These elliptical arches extend to the outer walls of the church,
thus partaking of the character of short barrel vaults.</p>

<p>Upon these arches is raised what has been called an elliptical
dome. But in no part has it the character of a true ellipse, nor
does it spring from its supporting arches in the simple regular
manner of a dome, but in the complex manner of a vault built upon
arches of unequal curvature. It should therefore rather be called a
domical vault. Where it shows above the roof it has the appearance
of a modified and very low cone covering an irregular elliptical
drum.</p>

<p>The eastern bay of the nave is square on plan, bounded by
semicircular arches, all extended so as to form short barrel
vaults. The western arch is joined to the eastern arch of the
western bay, thus forming a short barrel vault common to both bays.
The vault to the east runs to the semi-dome of the apse; whilst the
vaults to north and south, like the corresponding vaults in the
western bay, extend to the outer walls and cover the eastern
portions of the aisles and galleries. Above the supporting arches
regular pendentives are formed, and above these there is a drum
carrying a dome. The apse to the east of the nave is semicircular
within and covered by a semi-dome.</p>

<p>Between that semi-dome and the eastern barrel vault of the nave
a break is interposed, giving the bema arch two orders or faces,
with their external and internal angles rounded off, and the whole
surface of the semi-dome and of the bema arch is covered with
mosaic. At one time the mosaic extended also over the surface of
the barrel vault. The decoration in the semi-dome consists of a
large cross in black outline upon a gold ground; below the cross
there are three steps set upon a double band of green that runs
round the base of the semi-dome. A geometrical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> border
bounds the semi-dome, and then comes the following inscription, an
extract from Psalm lxv. verses 5, 6 (the lxiv. in the Septuagint
version), on the inner face of the arch:</p>

<p>Below the windows of the apse are ranges of seats for the
clergy, forming a sloping gallery, and consisting of eleven risers
and eleven treads, so that, according to the method of seating
adopted, there are five or six or eleven rows of seats. There is no
vestige of a special episcopal seat in the centre, but the
stonework has been disturbed; for some of the seats are built with
portions of the moulded base of the marble revetment of the
building. Underneath the seats runs a narrow semicircular passage
originally well lighted through openings<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
in the riser of one range of seats, and having a doorway at each

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 96.</i></p>


<p>On either side of the nave, towards the eastern end of each
aisle, there is an approximately square compartment covered with a
domical vault, and having an opening communicating with the nave
immediately to the west of the bema. To the east of these
compartments stands what was the original eastern wall of the
church, and in it, in the north aisle, a large doorway retaining
its architrave and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> cornice, is still found. Of the
corresponding doorway in the south aisle only the threshold is
left. These doorways must have communicated with the outer world to
the east of the church, like the doorways which occupy a similar
position in the Studion (p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>). The
northern compartment had an opening, which is still surmounted by
architrave and cornice, also in its north wall. There are,
moreover, four other openings or recesses in the northern wall of
the church, and two in the southern.</p>

<p>The main portions of the aisles are divided from the nave by
light screens of columns, the eastern and western portions being
connected by passages driven through the dome piers. In the eastern
nave bay there are four columns, giving five aisle bays on each
side. The columns are very slender, without any base moulding, and
stand upon square pedestals, now framed round with Turkish
woodwork. On opening one of these frames the pedestal was found to
be a mutilated and imperfectly squared block of stone. Such blocks
may have served as the core of a marble lining, or may be damaged
material re-used.</p>

<p>The capitals are of the 'Pseudo-Ionic' type, with roughly cut
Ionic volutes. The sinking on their lower bed is too large for the
necks of the columns. Towards the aisles they bear the monograms of
Justinian and Theodora, identical with the monograms of these
sovereigns in S. Sophia, while on the side towards the nave they
have a cross in low relief. Usually monograms are placed in the
more conspicuous position.</p>

<p>Above the capitals the vaulting that covers the aisles and
supports the galleries is of an uncommon type. Towards the nave the
arches are narrow and raised upon very high stilts; from each
capital a semicircular arch is thrown across to the outer wall,
where is a range of windows, each of which has an extrados at a
slightly higher level than the extrados of the corresponding nave
arch; and thus a long narrow space is left between the four arches
of each vault compartment that could be filled, wholly or in part,
without the use of centering. The result is a narrow, irregularly
curved vault, shaped to the backs of each of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span> surrounding
arches, and having, in the main, the character of a spherical
fragment.</p>

<p>The western portion of each aisle is divided from the nave by an
irregular arcade supported by a pier and one column, and,
consequently, there are three aisle bays to the western nave bay,
and not four as shown by Salzenburg.</p>

<p>The whole interior surfaces of the walls, up to the level of the
springing of the gallery vaulting, and the nave walls, up to the
gallery level, were once faced with marble. This is proved by the
presence in the walls of many marble plugs and some iron holdfasts,
as well as by remains of the moulded base of the facing.</p>

<p>At the eastern extremity of the aisles there are chambers formed
by walls built, as the vertical straight joints and difference of
materials employed indicate, at various periods. The chamber at the
end of the northern aisle has an archway, now built up, in its
eastern wall, and seems to have served as a vestibule. It is in
these chambers that Salzenberg supposes the staircases leading to
the galleries stood, but it is evident from the character of the
walls and vaulting that no such staircases could ever have existed
there.</p>

<p>The galleries extend over the narthex and over the whole length
of the aisles. Access to them is now obtained by a wooden staircase
and landing of Turkish construction, but how they were reached in
Byzantine times is not evident. Possibly the fragments of wall on
the exterior face of the south wall of the narthex and the traces
of vaulting beside them may be the remains of a staircase. Or a
staircase may have stood to the west of the narthex over the
vaulting of the atrium, where projecting spurs of walls appear.</p>

<p>The vaulting of the gallery over the narthex was originally
similar to that of the narthex itself, but only the cross-groined
vaults at the corners are Byzantine; the three central compartments
are Turkish. Five windows in the western wall looked into the
atrium, and as many openings in the eastern wall into the nave and
side galleries. Below the former range is a string-course
corresponding to that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>which runs round the interior of the
building at gallery level.</p>

<p>The gallery over each aisle consists of two open portions under
the dome arches, divided from each other by the dome piers, which
are pierced to connect the different parts of the gallery with each
other, and with the gallery over the narthex. In the side walls
there is a range of windows at gallery level; five on each side of
the eastern nave bay, three in the south wall of the western nave
bay, but none, at present, in its northern wall. Above these
windows are two ranges of windows in each lunette under the dome
arches, a system of five and three in the eastern bay, and of four
and two in the western bay. All these windows, now square-headed,
had originally semicircular heads. The lunette filling the western
dome arch had doubtless a similar window arrangement, though at
present it has only one window.</p>

<p>The eastern ends of the side galleries have been formed into
separate chambers since the Turkish occupation. Of the additions
beyond the original east wall of the church, that to the north was
connected with the gallery by a tall wide arch, while that to the
south was divided off from the gallery with only a small door as a
means of communication. The southern addition was divided into two
chambers as on the ground floor.</p>

<p>The walls above gallery level and the large vaulting surfaces of
the building are now covered with plaster, but a close examination
proves that if any mosaic or marble revetment ever existed above
gallery level, none of it, excepting the mosaic in the apse,
remains.</p>

<p>Looking next at the exterior of the building, it is to be
observed that the ground on the north, south, and east has been
raised as much as fifteen feet. In many places the walls have
undergone Turkish repair. The apse shows three sides. The drum of
the dome is pierced by twenty semicircular-headed windows (of which
only five are now open), and as their arches and the dome spring at
about the same level the heads of the windows impinge upon the
dome's surface. Two low shoulders cover the eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
pendentives. The plan of the drum is peculiar. From the shoulders,
just mentioned, to the windows, it is a square with rounded
corners, one side of the square being joined with and buried in the
drum of the western dome vault; but upon reaching the base of the
windows it becomes an accurate circle in plan, and at the springing
of the window arches is set back, leaving a portion of the piers to
appear as buttresses. The upper portion of the drum is carried well
up above the springing of the dome, leaving a large mass of
material properly disposed so as to take the thrusts produced.</p>

<p>The careful examination of the building by Mr. George has proved
that the fabric is not the work of one age, but consists of parts
constructed at different periods. For the full evidence on the
subject we must await the forthcoming monograph on the church.
Here, only the main results of Mr. George's survey can be
presented.</p>

<p>Up to the level of the springing of the aisle vaults, the walls
of the main body of the building, excepting the narthex and the
additions at the east end of the church, are built of large
well-squared stones laid in regular courses, and are homogeneous
throughout.</p>

<p>Above that level the walls are built in alternate bands of brick
and stone, five courses of brick to five courses of stone being the
normal arrangement. The stones in this portion of the walls are
smaller and much more roughly squared than those below the
springing of the aisle vaults. This brick and stone walling is, so
far as could be ascertained, homogeneous right up to the domical
vault and the dome. As usual the arches and vaults are in brick. A
point to be noted is that the recesses or openings in the lower
part of the north and south walls of the church do not centre with
the windows and vaulting above them; sometimes, indeed, the head of
an opening comes immediately below a vaulting arch or rib. Again,
at the north-eastern external angle of the apse the wall up to the
level of the springing of the aisle vaulting is in stone, but above
that level in brick, and the two portions differ in the angle which
they subtend. Evidently there has been rebuilding from a level
coinciding <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>with the springing of the aisle vaulting.
Projecting above the ground at the same place is a square mass of
stonework that was left unbuilt upon when that rebuilding took
place. The narthex is built of brick, with bands of large stone at
wide intervals, and is separated by distinct joints from the upper
and lower walls of the body of the church. Furthermore, while the
two eastern bays on each side of the western portion of the nave
continue and belong to the unusual system of vaulting followed in
the aisles, the bay on each side immediately adjoining the narthex
belongs to the vaulting system found in the narthex, and has,
towards the nave, an arch precisely similar to the arches between
the nave and the narthex. The division between the two systems is
well marked, both in the nave and in the aisles, and points clearly
to the fact that the narthex and the body of the church are of
different dates.</p>

<p>Thus the architectural survey of the building shows that the
principal parts of the fabric represent work done upon it on three
great occasions, a conclusion in striking accord with the
information already derived from history. For we have seen (<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>) that after the destruction of the
original Constantinian church by fire in the Nika Riot, Justinian
the Great erected a new sanctuary upon the old foundations; that
later in his reign another fire occurred which necessitated the
reconstruction of the narthex of that sanctuary; and that some two
centuries later, towards the close of the reign of Leo the
Isaurian, the church was shaken by one of the most violent
earthquakes known in Constantinople, and subsequently restored
probably by that emperor or by his son and successor Constantine
Copronymus. Accordingly, leaving minor changes out of account, it
is safe to suggest that the walls of the body of the church, up to
the springing of the aisle vaults, belong to the new church built
by Justinian after the Nika Riot in 532; while the narthex, the
aisle vaults immediately adjoining it, and the upper portion of the
western end of the south wall, represent the repairs made probably
by the same emperor after the injuries to the fabric caused by the
fire of 564. The earthquake of 740 must therefore have shaken down
or rendered unstable all the upper part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span> of the building, but
left standing the narthex, the gallery above it, and the lower part
of the walls of the church. Consequently, the upper part of the
building, the apse, the dome-arches, the dome-vault, and the dome
with its drum, belong to the reconstruction of the church after
that earthquake.</p>

<p>The buttresses to the apse where it joins the main eastern wall
are later additions, and still later, but before Turkish times, are
the short walls at the north and south-eastern corners forming the
small eastern chambers.</p>

<p>Of the building erected by Constantine the Great the only
possible vestige is the square projection at the north-eastern
angle of the apse, but that is an opinion upon which much stress
should not be laid.</p>

<p>In harmony with these conclusions is the evidence afforded by
the mosaics found in the church. Those of the narthex are of the
same character as the mosaics in S. Sophia, Constantinople, and may
well have been executed under Justinian. On the other hand, the
mosaics in the apse are characteristic of the iconoclastic period,
the chief decoration there being a simple cross. For, as Finlay<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143"
class="fnanchor">143</a> has remarked, Leo the Isaurian 'placed the
cross on the reverse of many of his gold, silver, and copper coins,
and over the gates of his palace, as a symbol for universal
adoration.' A similar iconoclastic decoration and a portion of the
same verses from Psalm lxv. formed the original decoration of the
apse in S. Sophia, Salonica.</p>

<p>Thus also is the presence of capitals bearing the monograms of
Justinian and Theodora explained, seeing those sovereigns were
intimately connected with the church. And thus also is a reason
suggested why those monograms face the aisles instead of the nave;
it was a position which would be assigned to them by a later
restorer of the church who was obliged to use old material, and at
the same time felt anxious to conceal the fact as much as possible,
lest the glory of the previous benefactors of the church should
eclipse his own renown.</p>

<p>The conclusion that in the present building we have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>parts
representing different periods solves also the problem of the
elliptical domical vault. For it is difficult to imagine that a
Byzantine architect with a free hand would choose to build such a
vault. But given the supports Mr. George believes were left
standing after the earthquake of 740, and given also the narthex on
the west, the architect's liberty was limited, and he would be
forced to cover the space thus bounded in the best way the
circumstances allowed.</p>

<p>How the western portion of the church was roofed in Justinian's
time it is impossible to say with certainty. There are buttress
slips in the south wall at gallery level and in the nave below,
where the break occurs in the arcade, that suggest the existence,
in the church as originally built by Justinian, of a narthex
carrying a gallery. In that case the length of the barrel vault
over the western part of the church would be about the length of
the barrel vault over the eastern part, and the church would then
show in plan a regular cross with a dome at the centre, two lateral
doors, one of which is now built up, giving access to the ends of
the narthex.</p>

<p>The dates here assigned to the different parts of the building
simplify the problem of the tall drum below the main dome. That
this could have been built by Justinian, as has been supposed, is
difficult of belief if the large domes which are known to have been
built by him are carefully examined. It is true that the drum dome
of S. Sophia, Salonica, has also been claimed for Justinian, but
that drum is low and only partially developed, and although its
date is not known, the consensus of opinion is against its being so
early. The whole question of the development of the drum still
awaits treatment at the hands of an investigator who has thoroughly
studied the buildings themselves, and perhaps the publication of
the results obtained by Mr. George at S. Sophia, Salonica, and S.
Irene, Constantinople, two crucial examples, will throw some light
on the subject. For the present the date here given for the drum of
S. Irene (<i>i.e.</i> towards the middle of the eighth century) is
an inherently probable one.</p>

<p>In the foregoing description of S. Irene there is no <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
pretence to an exhaustive statement of facts, or any claim that the
conclusions reached are final. There is still too much plaster on
the walls to permit a complete examination of the building. But the
conclusions here suggested are those which agree best with the
evidence which has been brought to light by Mr. George under

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. ANDREW IN KRISEI, HOJA MUSTAPHA PASHA
MESJEDI</h4>

<p>That the old Byzantine church now converted into the mosque
styled Hoja Mustapha Pasha Mesjedi, in the quarter of Juma Bazaar,
at a short distance to the east of the Gate of Selivria was the
church of S. Andrew in Krisei (&Mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &#7945;&gamma;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;
&#7944;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#8051;&omicron;&upsilon; &#7952;&nu;
&Kappa;&rho;&#8055;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;)<a name="FNanchor_144"
id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> can be established, by the indications which
Byzantine writers have given of the site of that famous church, and
by the legend which is still associated with the mosque. According
to Stephen of Novgorod<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
(c. 1350) the church dedicated to S. Andrew of Crete, who was
buried, as other authorities<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
inform us, in the district named Krisis, stood at a short distance
to the north of the monastery of the Peribleptos. It lay,
therefore, to the north of the Armenian church of S. George (Soulou
Monastir) in the quarter of Psamathia, which represents the church
of S. Mary Peribleptos. The mosque Hoja Mustapha Pasha Mesjedi lies
in the same direction. Again, according to Pachymeres,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> the church of S. Andrew in Krisei was near the
monastery of Aristina. That monastery, another authority states,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148"
class="fnanchor">148</a> was opposite the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>church of S. Mamas. The
church of S. Mamas was on the road between the Studion and the
church of S. Andrew.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Hence the church of
S. Andrew stood to the north of the Studion, the situation occupied
by Hoja Mustapha Pasha Mesjedi. Once more, the site of the mosque
corresponds to the position assigned to the church of S. Andrew on
the map of Bondelmontius (1420), to the east of the Gate of
Selivria. Finally, the old church is more definitely identified by
the legend of the judicial procedure which clings to the building.
In the picturesque courtyard of the mosque, where the colour of the
East is still rich and vivid, there stands an old cypress tree
around whose bare and withered branches a slender iron chain is
entwined like the skeleton of some extinct serpent. As tradition
would have it, the chain was once endowed with the gift of
judgment, and in cases of dispute could indicate which of the
parties concerned told the truth. One day a Jew who had borrowed
money from a Turk, on being summoned to pay his debt, replied that
he had done so already. To that statement the Turk gave the lie
direct, and accordingly, debtor and creditor were brought to the
chain for the settlement of the question at issue. Before
submitting to the ordeal, however, the Jew placed a cane into the
hands of the Turk, and then stood under the cypress confident that
his honour for truthfulness and honesty would be vindicated. His
expectation proved correct, for the chain touched his head to
intimate that he had returned the money he owed. Whereupon taking
back his cane he left the scene in triumph. Literally, the verdict
accorded with fact; for the cane which the Jew had handed to his
creditor was hollow and contained the sum due to the latter. But
the verdict displayed such a lack of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>insight, and involved so
gross a miscarriage of justice, that from that day forth the chain
lost its reputation and has hung ever since a dishonoured oracle on
the dead arms of the cypress, like a criminal on a gibbet. Although
this tale cannot be traced to its Byzantine source, it is
manifestly an echo of the renown which the precincts of the mosque
once enjoyed as a throne of judgment before Turkish times, and
serves to prove that Hoja Mustapha Pasha Mesjedi is indeed the old
church of S. Andrew in Krisei.</p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 106.</i></p>

<p>The earliest reference to the locality known as Krisis occurs in
the narrative of the martyrdom of S. Andrew of Crete given by
Symeon Metaphrastes,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> who flourished in the
latter part of the ninth century. A devoted iconodule, S. Andrew,
came from his native island to Constantinople, in the reign of
Constantine Copronymus (740-775), expressly to rebuke the emperor
for opposing the use of eikons in religious worship. As might have
been anticipated, the zeal and courage of the saint only incurred
cruel and insulting treatment, and at length a martyr's death. For,
while his persecutors were dragging him one day along the streets
of the city in derision, a half-witted fisherman stabbed him dead
with a knife. So strong was the feeling prevalent at the time
against the champion of the cause of eikons that his body was flung
among the corpses of murderers and thieves; but eventually his
admirers succeeded in removing it from its foul surroundings and
buried it 'in a sacred place which was named Krisis'
(&#949;&#7988;&#962;

id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> It is evident from this statement that the name
Krisis was applied to the locality before the interment of S.
Andrew there; how long before, it is impossible to say, but
probably from early times. The body of the martyr was laid in or
beside one of the two churches dedicated to saints also named S.
Andrew, which stood on the Seventh Hill of the city already in the
sixth century.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>One of these churches was dedicated to S. Andrew the Apostle,
and stood 'near the column,'
&pi;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&#8055;&omicron;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&sigma;&tau;&#8059;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;;<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> the other to S. Andrew, not otherwise
identified, was near the Gate of Saturninus,

&pi;&#8057;&rho;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Sigma;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&nu;&#8055;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">154</a> It is difficult to decide which church is
represented by the mosque. For there were two columns on the
Seventh Hill of the city: the Column of Constantine the Great,
which stood outside the city bounds, giving name to the extramural
district of the Exokionion now Alti Mermer; and the Column of
Arcadius now Avret Tash. Nor can the position of the Gate of
Saturninus be determined more accurately than that it was an
entrance in the portion of the Constantinian Walls which traversed
the Seventh Hill, the Xerolophos of Byzantine days. On the whole,
however, the indications favour the view that Hoja Mustapha Pasha
Mesjedi represents the church of S. Andrew near the Gate of
Saturninus. A church in that position, though outside the
Constantinian fortification, was still so near them that it could
be, very appropriately, described as near one of the city gates.
Again the Russian pilgrims<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>
who visited the shrines of Constantinople in the second quarter of
the fifteenth century found two churches dedicated to S. Andrew in
this part of the city, one to S. Andrew the Strategos, the other to
S. Andrew 'mad with the love of God' ('God-intoxicated'). In
proceeding northwards from the church of S. Diomed, which stood
near the Golden Gate (Yedi Koul&eacute;), the Russian visitor
reached first the sanctuary dedicated to S. Andrew the Strategos,
and then the church dedicated to S. Andrew the 'God-intoxicated,'
which lay still farther to the north. But this order in the
positions of the two churches implies that Hoja Mustapha Pasha
Mesjedi represents the church of S. Andrew the Strategos, a martyr
of the fourth century, viz. the church which the documents of the
sixth century describe as near the Gate of Saturninus, without
specifying by what title its patron saint was distinguished. This
agrees, moreover, with what is known regarding the site of the
church of S. Andrew the Apostle. It stood to the west of the
cistern of Mokius,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> the large ruined
Byzantine reservoir, now Tchoukour Bostan, to the north of Hoja
Mustapha Pasha Mesjedi.</p>
</div>

<p>The church does not appear again in history, under the
designation &#7952;&nu; &kappa;&rho;&#8055;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;,
until the reign of Andronicus II. (1282-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>1328), when it was
found, like so many other churches which survived the Latin
occupation of the city, in a state demanding extensive repair. It
was then embellished and enlarged by the protovestiarissa
Theodora,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> a lady who occupied a
prominent position in the society of the day, both as the emperor's
cousin, and on account of her accomplishments and character. In her
early youth she was married to George Muzalon,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> the favourite counsellor and trusted friend of
Theodore II. Ducas of Nicaea. What confidence Muzalon enjoyed may
be inferred from the fact that he was associated with the Patriarch
Arsenius as guardian of the emperor's son, John Lascaris, when left
the heir to the throne of Nicaea, as a child eight years old.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159"
class="fnanchor">159</a> Had Muzalon not met with an untimely end
he might have become the colleague of his ward, and Theodora might
have worn the imperial crown. The tragic murder of her husband by
his political opponents, while celebrating the obsequies of the
Emperor Theodore, provoked a terrible outburst of indignation and
grief on her part,<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> and so vehement was
her condemnation of the criminals that her uncle, the treacherous
Michael Palaeologus, threatened she would share her husband's fate
if she did not control her feelings.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
After the accession of Michael Palaeologus to the throne, her hand
was bestowed on the protovestiarius Raoul, and hence she is
generally known by his name and title as Raoulaina the
protovestiarissa (&#7969;
&#8172;&alpha;&omicron;&#8059;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&alpha;
&pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;&omicron;&beta;&epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;).
One of her beautiful daughters became the wife of Constantine
Palaeologus, the ill-fated brother of Andronicus II. But, as
already stated, Theodora was not only highly connected. Like many
noble ladies in Byzantine society, she cultivated learning,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> and took a deep interest in the theological
discussions and ecclesiastical affairs of her day. She was a
devoted adherent of the party attached to the person and memory of
the Patriarch Arsenius; the party that never forgave Michael
Palaeologus for blinding the young John Lascaris and robbing him of
the throne, the party that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111"
id="Page_111">111</a></span>opposed the subjection of the Eastern
Church to the Papal See, and which maintained the freedom of the
Church from the political interference of the emperor. Whatever its
faults, that party certainly represented the best moral life of the
period.</p>

<p>To heal the schism caused by the attitude of the Arsenites 'was
the serious labour of the Church and State' for half a century. And
in pursuance of the policy of conciliation, Andronicus II. allowed
the body of Arsenius to be brought to Constantinople from the
island of Proconessus, where he had died in exile and been buried.
The whole city gathered to welcome the remains of the venerated
prelate, and saw them borne in solemn and stately procession from
the landing at the Gate of Eugenius (Yali Kiosk) to the church of
S. Sophia. There, robed in pontifical vestments, the body was first
seated upon the patriarchal throne, then laid before the altar,
while the funeral service was intoned, and finally placed on the
right hand of the bema in a chest locked and sealed for safe
keeping. Once a week, however, the body was exposed to public view,
and all strife seemed hushed in a common devotion to the memory of
the saint. It was soon after this event that Theodora restored the
church and monastery of S. Andrew, and upon the completion of the
work she besought the emperor to allow the remains of Arsenius to
be transferred to that shrine. The request was granted, and the
body was carried to the church of St. Andrew with as great pomp and
ceremony as attended its arrival in the capital. There it was kept
until the patriarchate of Niphon (1311-1314), when it was again
taken to S. Sophia to appear in the final conclusion of peace
between the friends and foes of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_163"
id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> Standing beside the remains, Niphon pronounced,
in the name and by the authority of the dead man, a general
absolution for all offences committed in connection with the
quarrels which had raged around the name of Arsenius; and so long
as S. Sophia continued to be a Christian sanctuary the remains were
counted among the great treasures of the cathedral. 'There,' to
quote the words of a devout visitor <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>shortly before the Turkish
conquest, 'is found the body of the holy patriarch Arsenius, whose
body, still intact, performs many miracles.'<a name="FNanchor_164"
id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>During the closing years of her life Theodora made the monastery
or convent of S. Andrew in Krisei her home.<a name="FNanchor_165"
id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> To retire thus from the troubled sea of secular
life to the haven of a monastery, and there prepare for the voyage
beyond earthly scenes, was a common practice in the fashionable
world of the men and women of Byzantine days. And it was natural
for a wealthy traveller to leave at the port of call some splendid
token of devotion and gratitude. The protovestiarissa was still an
inmate of the monastery in 1289, when her friend the Patriarch
Gregory, to whom she was bound by many ties, was compelled to
resign.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> He was one of the most
learned men of his time and took an active part in the efforts to
reconcile the Arsenites. It was during his tenure of office that
the body of Arsenius was brought to the capital, and subsequently
transferred from S. Sophia to the church of S. Andrew; he also
opposed the union of the Churches, and in the controversy regarding
the 'Procession of the Holy Ghost' which divided Christendom, he
vigorously defended the doctrine of the Greek Communion against
Veccus, who championed the Latin Creed.</p>

<p>Strongly attached to her friends, and quick to resent any
injustice to them, Theodora came forward in the hour of the
patriarch's disgrace and offered him a refuge in the monastery of
Aristina, which stood, as we have seen, near the church of S.
Andrew and in the immediate neighbourhood of her own residence.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">167</a> It was a fortunate arrangement, for
Gregory soon fell seriously ill and required all the sympathy and
generous kindness which Theodora was able to extend to him.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> Upon his death, ten short months after his
retirement, Theodora determined to show again her admiration for
the man and his work by honouring his memory with a funeral
befitting the position he had held in the Church. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>She was
prevented from carrying out her intention only by the peremptory
and reiterated commands of the emperor, that Gregory should be
buried as a private person.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a>

<p>After the death of Theodora we have only occasional glimpses of
the church and monastery. In 1350 Stephen of Novgorod came 'to
kiss' the relics of S. Andrew of Crete, and describes the convent
as 'very beautiful.'<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Once, at least, a
sister proved too frail for her vocation;<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
sometimes a devout and wealthy inmate, such as Theognosia,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> would provide an endowment to enable poor girls
to become her heirs in religion; or the sisterhood was vexed by the
dishonesty of parties who had rented the lands from which the
convent derived its revenues.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
Towards the end of its Byzantine period another Russian pilgrim<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> came to honour the remains of S. Andrew
the Strategos, and bring the Christian history of the church to a
close. It was converted into a mosque by Mustapha Pasha, Grand
Vizier in the reign of Selim I. (1512-1520).<a name="FNanchor_175"
id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
The custom of illuminating the minarets of the

<a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>On account of the serious changes made in the building and its
surroundings when it became a mosque, and after the earthquake of
1765, its real character is not immediately apparent. The present
entrance is in the northern side, where a fine Turkish arcade has
been erected. The mihrab is on the south side, a greater change for
the correct orientation of a mosque than is usually necessary in
the adaptation of a church to the requirements of a sanctuary in
which the worshippers turn towards Mecca. To the east a hall has
been added for the accommodation of women who attend the services;
while on the west is another hall, where the dervishes of the
Tek&eacute; attached to the mosque <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>hold their meetings. The
north aisle also has been much altered and is covered with Turkish
domes.</p>

<p>The first impression produced by the interior of the building is
that we have here a church on the trefoil plan, similar to S. Mary
of the Mongols (p. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>) or S. Elias of
Salonica, for the central area is flanked by two semi-domes, which
with the eastern apse form a lobed plan at the vaulting level. A
closer examination of the building, however, will prove that we are
dealing with a structure whose original features have been
concealed by extensive Turkish alterations, and that the trefoil
form is a superficial disguise.</p>

<p>The arches supporting the central dome on the north and south
sides are filled in with semi-domes which rest on arches thrown
diagonally across the 'aisles' on each side of the central dome.
These arches are very clumsily set to the sides of an irregular
hexagon, with the central wall arch much larger than the side
arches. They have no responds, and have every appearance of being
makeshifts.</p>

<p>The eastern dome arch is prolonged into a barrel-vaulted bema,
flanked by shallow niches leading to the prothesis and diaconicon,
and beyond the bema is the semicircular apse. Only the diaconicon
now remains, covered by a cross-groined vault, and its apse pierced
by a door leading to the hall of the Tek&eacute;. The place of the
prothesis has been taken by a similar door and a small Turkish
dome.</p>

<p>The western dome arch is filled in with a triple arcade resting
on two marble columns with finely carved cubical capitals. Above
the arcade is a group of three windows whose heads are circular on
the inside, but pointed on the outside. To the west of this arcade
is an oblong passage corresponding to the 'inner narthex' of S.
Theodosia. It is in three bays. The central long bay is
barrel-vaulted; the two outer bays open into the north and south
'aisles'; the bay to the north is covered by a Turkish dome, while
that to the south has a cross-groined vault which seems to be
original.</p>

<p>Beyond this to the west is the outer narthex, a fine piece of
work, and, from the character of its details, of the same period as
the western dome arcade. It is in five bays. <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>The three
central bays correspond to the 'inner narthex'; the middle bay is
covered by a low saucer dome on pendentives, and is separated from
the two side bays by columns set against flat pilasters. The latter
bays are covered by groined vaults springing from the imposts of
the capitals, which are of the Byzantine Ionic type, with high
carved imposts. They resemble the capitals in the gallery of SS.
Sergius and Bacchus, and are worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p>The two outer bays are separated from the central compartment of
three bays by strongly projecting pilasters. They are covered by
low saucer domes similar to the dome over the central bay, and
communicate on the east with the 'aisles.' Both outer and inner
narthexes are in one story, above which rise the windows of the
western dome arch and the semi-domes on north and south.</p>

<p>Turning now to the exterior, the south wall is the only outer
wall which is exposed at the ground level. It is faced with finely
dressed and polished stone, with thin joints, no tiles, and a
stone-moulded cornice. The windows are covered with four centred
Turkish arches and are evident insertions. Above the stone cornice
rise the low drums of the semi-domes. These, as well as the square
base of the dome and the dome itself, are faced with polished stone
alternating with courses of three bricks set in thick beds of
mortar. The angles are plain, without shafts, and the drums, dome
base, and dome are crowned with stone cornices moulded to a
reversed ogee.</p>

<p>The north and south semi-domes are each pierced by three large
windows, which on the interior cut through the curved surface of
the domes, and on the exterior appear as dormers in the roof above
the cornice. Accordingly they are double glazed, with one glazed
frame on the inside corresponding to the curved dome surface, and a
second upright glazed frame on the outside. The roofs are covered
with lead.</p>

<p>The central dome is circular inside, with a high drum pierced by
eight windows. On the outside it is octagonal, with a window on
each side. These have circular arched heads, but have no moulding,
shaft, or inset to either arches<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> or sides. The dome is
crowned by a moulded stone cornice of the same type as that of the
other walls.</p>

<p>In attempting to reconstruct the original form of the church we
may first note those features which are evidently Turkish. None of
the exterior masonry is Byzantine, as the use of polished ashlar
with fine joints, of pointed arches, and of moulded stone cornices
clearly proves. The absence of shafts at the angles of the dome
drums and the unrecessed windows are additional proofs of this
fact, and we may conclude that the entire exterior was refaced in
Turkish times.</p>

<p>The diagonal arches under the north and south semi-domes are
peculiar. Furthermore, in lobed Byzantine churches the lateral
apses project beyond the square outer walls. Here they are
contained within the walls.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>Nor are the semi-domes themselves Byzantine in character. The
large windows in the dome surface and the lead-covered dormers
placed above the flat moulded cornice betray a Turkish hand; for
windows in the dome are universal in the great Turkish mosques, and
the method of protecting them on the exterior with wooden dormers
is quite foreign to Byzantine ideas. The form of the drums and
cornices should be compared with the minor domes of the mosque of
Sultan Bayazid.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the building has led to the following
conclusions. The lateral semi-domes with their supporting arches
are a Turkish addition. The central dome, including the drum, is
probably entirely Turkish, and takes the place of an original
ribbed dome. The two easternmost domes in the north 'aisle' and
those over the inner narthex and the prothesis are also Turkish,
and, as already stated, the exterior of the entire building. On the
other hand, the eastern apse, the dome arches, the arcade, and the
windows above it on the west side of the dome, the inner narthex
with the ground vault to the south of it, and the entire outer
narthex, are parts of the original building, dating probably from
the sixth or seventh century. <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>It should be particularly
noticed that the windows over the western dome arcade are
circular-headed inside, though they have been provided with pointed
heads on the outside in the process of refacing.</p>

<p>If we stand in the northern lateral apse and face the mihrab the
reason for the alterations is evident. The original Christian
orientation is ignored, and the apses, in place of being lateral,
are terminal. To the left is the old apse left unaltered; to the
right, the original filling of the dome arch forms a 'nave-arcade'
similar to that of the mosque of Sultan Bayazid; while by means of
the additional apses the building has been converted into a
miniature imperial mosque of the S. Sophia type, a distinctly
clever piece of Turkish alteration.</p>

<p>In its original form the central dome was surrounded by an
'ambulatory' of one story formed by the aisles and 'inner narthex.'
Such a plan is common to both the domed basilica type and the domed
cross type, the difference depending upon the treatment of the
cross arms above. In both types, however, the side dome arches are
invariably filled in with arcades similar to that filling in the
western arch of S. Andrew. We are therefore justified in restoring
such arcades here. The type thus restored differs from the domed
cross church in that the cross arms do not extend to the outer
walls, and from the domed basilica in that the western dome arch is
treated in a similar manner to the lateral arches. To this type the
term 'ambulatory church' may be applied.</p>

<p>Adjoining the west end of the church is the fine cloister of the
Tek&eacute; of dervishes, probably on the lines of the old
monastery. All the columns around the court are Byzantine, and one
of them bears the inscription: the (column) of,
Theophane&mdash;&#7969; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&Theta;&epsilon;&omega;&phi;&#8049;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; (<a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>).
In the south wall is built a beautiful
Byzantine doorway having jambs and lintel decorated on the face
with a broad undercut scroll of flat leaves and four-petalled
flowers, running between two rows of egg and dart, while on the
intrados are two bands of floral ornaments separated by a bead
moulding. One of the bands is clearly a vine scroll. The method
employed here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of joining leaves to a centre so as to
form spiral rosettes, is found also on some of the small capitals
in S. Sophia. Similar rosettes appear in the decoration of the
doorway to the Holy Sepulchre on the ivory in the Trivulce
collection at Milan.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARY (PANACHRANTOS) OF LIPS, PHENER&Eacute;
ISA MESJEDI</h4>

<p>The old Byzantine church, now Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi, in the
valley of the Lycus, to the south of the mosque of Sultan Mehemed,
should be identified as the church of the Theotokos of Lips,
although the Patriarch Constantius,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>
Scarlatus Byzantius and Paspates<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
identify that church with Demirjilar Mesjedi, a building which lay
to the east of the mosque of Sultan Mehemed, but fell in the
earthquake of 1904. According to the writers just cited,
Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi is the church of the Theotokos
Panachrantos which appears in connection with certain incidents in
the history of the Patriarch Veccus. In this view there is a
curious mingling of truth and error. For, as a matter of fact,
Constantinople did possess a church dedicated to the Panachrantos
which had no connection with the monastery of Lips. But that church
was not the building in the valley of the Lycus; it stood in the
immediate vicinity of S. Sophia. Furthermore, while it is certain
that there was in the city a church of the Panachrantos which had
nothing whatever to do with the monastery of Lips, it is equally
true that the sanctuary attached to that monastery was also
dedicated to the Theotokos under the same style. In other words,
Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi was the sanctuary attached to the
monastery <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>of
Lips and was dedicated to the Theotokos
Panachrantos, but was not the church of that name with which it has
been identified by the authorities above mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a>

<p>The correctness of these positions can be readily established.
First, that a monastery of the Panachrantos and the monastery of
Lips were different Houses is evident from the express statements
of the pilgrim Zosimus to that effect. For, according to that
visitor to the shrines of the city, a monastery, 'de Panakhran,'<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> stood near S. Sophia, 'non loin de Sainte
Sophie.' Stephen of Novgorod refers to the monastery of the
'Panacrante'<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> also in the same
connection. And the proximity of the House to the great cathedral
may be inferred likewise from the statements of the pilgrim
Alexander<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> and of the anonymous
pilgrim.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> On the other hand, Zosimus
speaks of the monastery of Lips, 'couvent de femmes Lipesi,'<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> as situated in another part of the city.
It was closely connected with the monastery of Kyra Martha,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> from which to S. Sophia was a far cry. The
distinction of the two monasteries is, moreover, confirmed by the
historians Pachymeres<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
and Nicephorus Gregoras,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>
who employ the terms Panachrantos and Lips to designate two
distinct monastic establishments situated in different quarters of
the capital.<br />
<br />
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="fig_41" id="fig_41"></a>
<img src="images/fig_41.png" width="500" height="317"
alt="Details of the Shafts in East Windows of South Church." title="" />
 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the next place, the monastery of Lips did not stand at the
point marked by Demirjilar Mesjedi. The argument urged in favour of
its position at that point is the fact that the monastery is
described as near the church of the Holy Apostles
(&pi;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&#8055;&omicron;&nu;
&tau;&#8182;&nu;
&#7937;&gamma;&#8055;&omega;&nu;
&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#8057;&lambda;&omega;&nu;). But
while proximity to the Holy Apostles must mark any edifice claiming
to be the monastery of Lips, that proximity <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>alone is
not sufficient to identify the building. Phener&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Isa Mesjedi satisfies that condition equally
well. But what turns the balance of evidence in its favour is that
it satisfies also every other condition that held true of the
monastery of Lips. That House was closely associated with the
monastery of Kyra Martha, as Phrantzes<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
expressly declares, and as may be inferred from the narratives of
the Russian pilgrims.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>
That being so, the position of Kyra Martha will determine likewise
that of the monastery of Lips. Now, Kyra Martha lay to the south of
the Holy Apostles. For it was reached, says the anonymous pilgrim
of the fifteenth century<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
'en descendent (du couvent) des Ap&ocirc;tres <i>dans la direction
du midi</i>'; while Stephen of Novgorod<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
reached the Holy Apostles in proceeding northwards from the Kyra
Martha. Hence the monastery of Lips lay to the south of the Holy
Apostles, as Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi stands to the south of the
mosque <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>of
Sultan Mehemed, which has replaced that famous church.</p>

<p>With this conclusion agrees, moreover, the description given of
the district in which the monastery of Lips stood. It was a remote
and quiet part of the city, like the district in which
Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi is situated to-day;
&pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8048; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Lambda;&#8055;&beta;&alpha; &mu;&#8051;&rho;&eta;,
&tau;&#8057;&pi;&omicron;&nu;
&#7936;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&omicron;&nu;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7973;&sigma;&upsilon;&chi;&omicron;&nu;.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Furthermore, the monastery of Lips
borrowed its name from its founder or restorer, Constantine Lips;<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> and in harmony with that fact we find on
the apse of one of the two churches which combine to form
Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi an inscription in honour of a certain
Constantine.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Unfortunately the
inscription is mutilated, and there were many Constantines besides
the one surnamed Lips. Still, the presence of the principal name of
the builder of the monastery of Lips on a church, which we have
also other reasons to believe belonged to that monastery, adds
greatly to the cumulative force of the argument in favour of the
view that Constantine Lips is the person intended. But, if
necessary, the argument can be still further strengthened. The
church attached to the monastery of Lips was dedicated to the
Theotokos, as may be inferred from the circumstance that the annual
state visit of the emperor to that shrine took place on the
festival of the Nativity of the Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
So likewise was the sanctuary which Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi
represents, for the inscription it bears invokes her blessing upon
the building and its builder (Fig. <a href="#fig_42">42</a>). Would
that the identity of all the churches in Constantinople could be as
strongly established.</p>

<p>It remains to add in this connection that while the monastery of
Lips and that of the Panachrantos associated with Veccus were
different Houses, the churches of both monasteries were dedicated
to the Theotokos under the <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>same attribute&mdash;Panachrantos, the
Immaculate. The invocation inscribed on Phener&eacute; Isa Mesjedi
addresses the Theotokos by that epithet. But to identify different
churches because of the same dedication is only another instance of
the liability to allow similarity of names to conceal the
difference between things.</p>

<p>The distinction thus established between the two monasteries is
important not only in the interests of accuracy; it also throws
light on the following historical incidents. In 1245 permission was
granted for the transference of the relics of S. Philip the Apostle
from the church of the Panachrantos to Western Europe. The document
authorising that act was signed by the dean of the church and by
the treasurer of S. Sophia.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
The intervention of the latter official becomes more intelligible
when we know that the monastery of the Panachrantos stood near S.
Sophia, and not, as Paspates maintains, at Phener&eacute; Isa
Mesjedi. Again, the Patriarch Veccus took refuge on two occasions
in the monastery of the Panachrantos, once in 1279 and again in
1282. He could do so readily and without observation, as the case
demanded, when the shelter he sought stood in the immediate
vicinity of his cathedral and official residence. To escape to a
monastery situated in the valley of the Lycus was, under the
circumstances, impracticable.</p>

<p>Constantine Lips was an important personage during the reign of
Leo the Wise (886-912) and of Constantine VII. Porphyrogenitus
(912-956). Under the former emperor he held the offices of
protospatharius and domestic of the household. He also went on
several missions to the Prince of Taron, in the course of which
romance mingled with politics, with the result that the daughter of
Lips became engaged to the son of the prince.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Upon the accession of Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, Lips came under a cloud, on suspicion of being
implicated in the plot to raise Constantine Ducas to the throne,
and was obliged to flee <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the capital.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>
Eventually he was restored to favour, and enjoyed the dignities of
patrician, proconsul, commander of the foreign guard, and
drungarius of the fleet.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
He fell in battle in the war of 917 between the Empire and the
Bulgarians under Symeon.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>The monastery of Lips was restored in the reign of Leo the Wise;
the festival of the dedication of the church being celebrated in
the year 908, in the month of June.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
The emperor honoured the occasion with his presence, and attended a
banquet in the refectory of the monastery. But the happy
proceedings had not gone far, when they were suddenly interrupted
by a furious south-west wind which burst upon the city and shook
houses and churches with such violence that people feared to remain
under cover and imagined that the end of the world had come, until
the storm was allayed by a heavy downpour of rain. As the
south-west wind was named Lips, it is not clear whether the
historians who mention this incident intend to explain thereby the
origin of Constantine's surname, or simply point to a curious
coincidence.</p>

<p>Near the church Lips erected also a xenodocheion for the
reception of strangers.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
The monastery is mentioned by the Anonymus of the eleventh
century,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> but does not appear again
until the recovery of the Empire from the Latins in 1261. In the
efforts then made to restore all things, it underwent repairs at
the instance of the Empress Theodora,<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>
the consort of Michael Palaeologus, and from that time acquired
greater importance than it had previously enjoyed. Within its
precincts, on the 16th of February 1304, a cold winter day,
Theodora herself was laid to rest with great pomp, and amid the
tears of the poor to whom she had been a good friend.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> There, two years later, a splendid service was
celebrated for the benefit of the soul of her son Constantine
Porphyrogenitus,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> as some compensation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
for the cruel treatment he had suffered at
the hands of his jealous brother Andronicus. There, that emperor
himself became a monk two years before his death,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> and there he was buried on the 13th of February
1332. The monastery contained also the tomb of the Empress Irene,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> first wife of Andronicus III., and the
tomb of the Russian Princess Anna<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>
who married John VII. Palaeologus while crown prince, but died
before she could ascend the throne, a victim of the great plague
which raged in Constantinople in 1417. The monastery appears once
more as the scene of a great religious revival, when a certain nun
Thomais, who enjoyed a great reputation for sanctity, took up her
residence in the neighbourhood. So large were the crowds of women
who flocked to place themselves under her rule that 'the monastery
of Lips and Martha' was filled to overflowing.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>The church was converted into a mosque by Phener&eacute; Isa,
who died in 1496, and has undergone serious alterations since that
time.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The building comprises two churches, which, while differing in
date and type, stand side by side, and communicate with each other
through an archway in their common wall, and through a passage in
the common wall of their narthexes. As if to keep the two churches
more closely together, they are bound by an exonarthex, which,
after running along their western front, returns eastwards along
the southern wall of the south church as a closed cloister or
gallery.</p>

<p><i>The North Church.</i>&mdash;The north church is of the normal
'four column' type. The four columns which originally supported the
dome were, however, removed when the building was converted into a
mosque in Turkish times, and have been replaced by two large
pointed arches which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
span the entire length of the church. But
the old wall arches of the dome-columns are still visible as arched
piercings in the spandrils of the Turkish arches. A similar Turkish
'improvement' in the substitution of an arch for the original pair
of columns is found in the north side of the parecclesion attached
to the Pammakaristos (p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a>). The dome
with its eight windows is likewise Turkish. The windows are
lintelled and the cornice is of the typical Turkish form. The bema
is almost square and is covered by a barrel vault formed by a
prolongation of the eastern dome arch; the apse is lighted by a
lofty triple window. By what is an exceptional arrangement, the
lateral chapels are as lofty both on the interior and on the
exterior as is the central apse, but they are entered by low doors.
In the normal arrangement, as, for instance, in the Myrelaion, the
lateral chapels are low and are entered by vaults rising to the
same height as those of the angle chambers, between which the
central apse rises higher both externally and internally.</p>

<p>The chapels have niches arched above the cornice on three sides,
and are covered by cross-groined vaults which combine with the
semicircular heads of the niches to produce a very beautiful
effect. To the east they have long bema arches flanked by two small
semicircular niches, and are lighted by small single windows.</p>

<p>The church is preceded by a narthex in three bays covered by
cross-groined vaults supported on strong transverse arches. At
either end it terminates in a large semicircular niche. The
northern one is intact, but of the southern niche only the arched
head remains. The lower part of the niche has been cut away to
afford access to the narthex of the south church. This would
suggest that, at least, the narthex of the south church is of later
date than the north church.</p>

<p>Considered as a whole the north church is a good example of its
type, lofty and delicate in its proportions.</p>

<p><i>The South Church.</i>&mdash;The narthex is unsymmetrical to
the church and in its present form must be the result of extensive
alteration. It is in two very dissimilar bays. That to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
north is covered with a cross-groined vault of lath and plaster,
probably on the model of an original vault constructed of brick. A
door in the eastern wall leads to the north aisle of the church.
The southern bay is separated from its companion by a broad arch.
It is an oblong chamber reduced to a figure approaching a square by
throwing broad arches across its ends and setting back the wall
arches from the cornice. This arrangement allows the bay to be
covered by a low drumless dome. Two openings, separated by a pier,
lead respectively to the nave and the southern aisle of the
church.</p>

<p>The interior of the church has undergone serious alterations
since it has become a mosque, but enough of the original building
has survived to show that the plan was that of an 'ambulatory
church.'</p>

<p>Each side of the ambulatory is divided into three bays, covered
with cross-groined vaults whose springings to the central area
correspond exactly to the columns of such an arcade as that which
occupies the west dome bay of S. Andrew (p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>).
We may therefore safely assume that triple arcades
originally separated the ambulatory from the central area and
filled in the lower part of the dome arches. The tympana of these
arches above were pierced to north, south, and west by three
windows now built up but whose outlines are still visible beneath
the whitewash which has been daubed over them. The angles of the
ambulatory are covered by cross vaults.</p>

<p>The pointed arches at present opening from the ambulatory to the
central area were formed to make the church more suitable for
Moslem worship, as were those of the north church. In fact we have
here a repetition of the treatment of the Pammakaristos (<a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>),
when converted into a mosque. The use of
cross-groined vaults in the ambulatory is a feature which
distinguishes this church from the other ambulatory churches of
Constantinople and connects it more closely with the domed-cross
church. The vaults in the northern portion of the ambulatory have
been partially defaced in the course of Turkish repairs.</p>

<p>The central apse is lighted by a large triple window.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> It
is covered by a cross-groined vault and has on each side a tall
shallow segmental niche whose head rises above the springing
cornice. Below this the niches have been much hacked away. The
passages leading to the lateral chapels are remarkably low, not
more than 1.90 m. high to the crown of the arch.</p>

<p>The southern chapel is similar to the central apse, and is
lighted by a large triple window. The northern chapel is very
different. It is much broader; broader indeed than the ambulatory
which leads to it, and is covered by barrel vaults. The niches in
the bema only rise to a short distance above the floor, not, as on
the opposite side, to above the cornice. It is lighted by a large
triple window similar to those of the other two apses.<br />

<p>The outer narthex on the west of the two churches and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the gallery on the south of the south church are covered with
cross-groined vaults without transverse arches. The wall of the
south church, which shows in the south gallery, formed the original
external wall of the building. It is divided into bays with arches
in two and three orders of brick reveals, and with shallow niches
on the broader piers.</p>

<p>The exterior of the two churches is very plain. On the west are
shallow wall arcades in one order, on the south similar arcades in
two orders. The northern side is inaccessible owing to the Turkish
houses built against it.</p>

<p>On the east all the apses project boldly. The central apse of
the south church has seven sides and shows the remains of a
decoration of niches in two stories similar to that of the
Pantokrator (p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>); the other apses
present three sides. The carved work on the window shafts is
throughout good. An inscription commemorating the erection of the
northern church is cut on a marble string-course which, when
complete, ran across the whole eastern end, following the
projecting sides of the apses. The letters are sunk and marked with
drill holes.</p>

<p>Wulff is of opinion that the letters were originally filled in
with lead, and, from the evidence of this lead infilling, dates the
church as late as the fifteenth century. But it is equally possible
that the letters were marked out by drill holes which were then
connected with the chisel, and that the carver, pleased by the
effect given by the sharp points of shadow in the drill holes,
deliberately left them. The grooves do not seem suitable for
retaining lead.</p>

<p>In the course of their history both churches were altered, even
in Byzantine days. The south church is the earlier structure, but
shows signs of several rebuildings. The irregular narthex and
unsymmetrical eastern side chapels are evidently not parts of an
original design. In the wall between the two churches there are
indications which appear to show the character of these alterations
and the order in which the different buildings were erected.</p>

<p>As has already been pointed out, the north side of the
ambulatory in the south church, which for two-thirds of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
length is of practically the same width as the southern and western
sides, suddenly widens out at the eastern end and opens into a side
chapel broader than that on the opposite side. The two large piers
separating the ambulatory from the central part of the north church
are evidently formed by building the wall of one church against the
pre-existing wall of the other. The easternmost pier is smaller
and, as can be seen from the plan, is a continuation of the wall of
the north church. Clearly the north church was already built when
the north-eastern chapel of the south church was erected, and the
existing wall was utilised. As the external architectural style of
the three apses of the south church is identical, it is reasonable
to conclude that this part of the south church also is later in
date than the north church. For if the entire south church had been
built at the same time as the apses, we should expect to find the
lateral chapels similar. But they are not. The vaulting of the
central apse and of the southern lateral chapel are similar, while
that of the northern chapel is different. On the same supposition
we should also expect to find a similar use of the wall of the
north church throughout, but we have seen that two piers
representing the old wall of the south church still remain. The
narthex of the south church, however, is carried up to the line of
the north church wall.</p>

<p>The four column type is not found previous to the tenth century.
The date of the north church was originally given on the
inscription, but is now obliterated. Kondakoff dates it in the
eleventh or twelfth century. Wulff would put it as late as the
fifteenth. But if the view that this church was attached to the
monastery of Lips is correct, the building must belong to the tenth
century.</p>

<p>The ambulatory type appears to be early, and the examples in
Constantinople seem to date from the sixth to the ninth century. It
may therefore be concluded that, unless there is proof to the
contrary, the south church is the earlier. In that case the
southernmost parts of the two large piers which separate the two
churches represent the old outer wall of the original south church,
whose eastern chapels were then symmetrical. To this the north
church was added, but at<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> some subsequent date the apses of the
south church demanded repair and when they were rebuilt, the
north-eastern chapel was enlarged by the cutting away of the old
outer wall. To this period also belongs the present inner narthex.
The fact that the head of the terminal niche at the south end of
the north narthex remains above the communicating door shows that
the south narthex is later. The outer narthex and south gallery are
a still later addition.<br />

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF THE THEOTOKOS PAMMAKARISTOS, FETIYEH JAMISSI</h4>

<p>The Byzantine church, now Fetiyeh Jamissi, overlooking the
Golden Horn from the heights of the Fifth Hill, was the church of
the Theotokos Pammakaristos (the All Blessed), attached to the
monastery known by that name.</p>

<p>Regarding the identity of the church there can be no manner of
doubt, as the building remained in the hands of the Greek community
for 138 years after the conquest, and was during that period the
patriarchal cathedral.</p>

<p>The questions when and by whom the church was founded cannot be
so readily determined. According to a manuscript in the library of
the Greek theological college on the island of Halki (one of the
small group of islands known as the Princes' Islands in the Sea of
Marmora), an inscription in the bema of the church ascribed the
foundation of the building to John Comnenus and his wife Anna.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The manuscript perished in the earthquake
which reduced the college to a heap of ruins in 1894, but the
inscription had fortunately been copied in the catalogue of the
library before that disaster occurred. It read as follows:</p>

The legend cannot refer to the Emperor
John Comnenus (1118-1143), for his consort was neither named Anna
nor related to the family of Ducas. She was a Hungarian princess,
who, on becoming the emperor's bride, assumed the name Irene. Mr.
Siderides, therefore, suggests that the persons mentioned in the
inscription were that emperor's grandparents, the curopalates and
grand domestic John Comnenus and his wife, the celebrated Anna
Dalassena, who bore likewise the title of Ducaena. In that case, as
the curopalates and grand domestic died in 1067, the foundation of
the church cannot be much later than the middle of the eleventh
century. But whether the term
&phi;&rho;&#8057;&nu;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&alpha; should be
understood to mean that the church was founded by the illustrious
persons above mentioned, or was an object already in existence upon
which they bestowed their thought and care, is not quite certain.
Mr. Siderides is prepared to adopt the latter meaning, and the
architecture of the church allows us to assign the foundation of
the building to an earlier date than the age of the grandparents of
the Emperor John Comnenus. But while the connection of the church
with those personages must not be overlooked, the building
underwent such extensive repairs in the thirteenth century that the
honour of being its founder was transferred to its restorer at that
period. Pachymeres<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> speaks of the
monastery as the monastery of Michael Glabas Tarchaniotes
(&tau;&#8052;&nu; &#7984;&delta;&#8055;&alpha;&nu;
&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8053;&nu;]). While the poet Philes (1275-1346),
referring to a figure portrayed on the walls of the church, asks
the spectator,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Seest thou, O stranger, this great man? He is none other than
the protostrator, the builder of this monastery, the wonder of the
world, the noble Glabas.</p>

<p>Michael Glabas was created protostrator in 1292, and acquired
the right to appoint the abbot of the monastery before 1295.
Consequently the completion of the repair of the church at his
instance must be assigned to the interval between these dates.</p>

<p>The protostrator Michael Glabas Ducas Tarchaniotes, who must not
be confounded with his namesake the protovestiarius Michael
Palaeologus Tarchaniotes,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>
enjoyed the reputation of an able general and wise counsellor in
the reign of Andronicus II., although, being a victim to gout, he
was often unable to serve his country in the former capacity. He
was noted also for his piety and his interest in the poor, as may
be inferred from his restoration of the Pammakaristos and the
erection of a xenodocheion.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
His wife was a niece of the Emperor Michael Palaeologus, and
related, as her titles imply, to other great families in the
country. A pious woman, and devoted to her husband, she proved the
sincerity of her affection by erecting to his memory, as will
appear in the sequel, the beautiful chapel at the south-east end of
the church. Before her death she<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
retired from the world and
assumed the name Martha in religion.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>In addition to the figures of the restorers of the church,
portraits in mosaic of the Emperor Andronicus and his Empress Anna,
as the legends beside the portraits declared, stood on the right of
the main entrance to the patriarchate.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a>

<p>As both Andronicus II. and his grandson Andronicus III. were
married to ladies named Anna, it is not clear which of these
imperial couples was here portrayed. The fact that the consort of
the former emperor died before the restoration of the church by the
protostrator Michael is certainly in favour of the view supported
by Mr. Siderides that the portraits represented the latter emperor
and empress.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> Why these personages were
thus honoured is not explained.</p>

<p>Having restored the monastery, Michael Glabas entrusted the
direction of its affairs to a certain monk named Cosmas, whom he
had met and learned to admire during an official tour in the
provinces. In due time Cosmas was introduced to Andronicus II., and
won the imperial esteem to such an extent as to be appointed
patriarch.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The new prelate was
advanced in years, modest, conciliatory, but, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>withal,
could take a firm stand for what he considered right. On the other
hand, the piety of Andronicus was not of the kind that adheres
tenaciously to a principle or ignores worldly considerations. Hence
occasions for serious differences between the two men on public
questions were inevitable, and in the course of their disputes the
monastery of the Pammakaristos, owing to its association with
Cosmas, became the scene of conflicts between Church and State.</p>

<p>No act of Andronicus shocked the public sentiment or his day
more painfully than the political alliance he cemented by giving
his daughter Simonis, a mere child of six years, as a bride to the
Kraal of Servia, who was forty years her senior, and had been
already married three times, not always, it was alleged, in the
most regular manner.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Cosmas did everything
in his power to prevent the unnatural union, and when his last
desperate effort to have an audience of the emperor on the subject
was repelled, he left the patriarchal residence and retired to his
old home at the Pammakaristos. There, during the absence of the
emperor in Thessalonica, where the objectionable marriage was
celebrated, Cosmas remained for two years, attending only to the
most urgent business of the diocese.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
Upon the return of Andronicus to the capital, Cosmas was
conspicuous by his refusal to take part in the loyal demonstrations
which welcomed the emperor back. Andronicus might well have seized
the opportunity to remove the patriarch from office for discourtesy
so marked and offensive, but, instead of doing so, he sent a
friendly message to the Pammakaristos, asking Cosmas to forget all
differences and resume his public duties. Achilles in his tent was
not to be conciliated so easily. To the imperial request Cosmas
replied by inviting Andronicus to come to the Pammakaristos, and
submit the points at issue between the emperor and himself to a
tribunal of bishops and other ecclesiastics specially convened for
the purpose. He furthermore declared that he would return to the
patriarchal residence only if the verdict of the court <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> was in
his favour, otherwise he would resign office. The public feeling
against Andronicus was so strong that he deemed it expedient to
comply with this strange demand, going to the monastery late at
night to escape notice. The tribunal having been called to order,
Cosmas produced his charges against the emperor: the Servian
marriage; oppressive taxes upon salt and other necessaries of life,
whereby a heavy burden was laid upon the poor, on one hand, and
imperial prodigality was encouraged on the other; failure to treat
the petitions addressed to him by Cosmas with the consideration
which they deserved. The defence of Andronicus was skilful. He
maintained that no marriage of the Kraal had violated Canon Law as
some persons claimed. He touched the feelings of his audience by
dwelling upon the sacrifice he had made as a father in bestowing
the hand of a beloved daughter on such a man as the Servian Prince;
only reasons of State had constrained him to sanction a union so
painful to his heart. The taxes to which objection had been taken
were not imposed, he pleaded, to gratify any personal love of
money, but were demanded by the needs of the Empire. As to love of
money, he had reasons to believe that it was a weakness of which
his accuser was guilty, and to prove that statement, he there and
then sent two members of the court to the treasurer of the palace
for evidence in support of the charge. In regard to the accusation
that he did not always favour the petitions addressed to him by the
patriarch, he remarked that it was not an emperor's duty to grant
all the petitions he received, but to discriminate between them
according to their merits. At the same time he expressed his
readiness to be more indulgent in the future. Moved by these
explanations, as well as by the entreaties of the emperor and the
bishops present at this strange scene, held in the dead of night in
the secrecy of the monastery, Cosmas relented, and returned next
day to the patriarchate.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>But peace between the two parties was not of long duration. Only
a few weeks later Andronicus restored to office a bishop of Ephesus
who had been canonically deposed. Cosmas <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>protested, and when his
remonstrances were disregarded, he withdrew again to the
Pammakaristos,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> and refused to allow his
seclusion to be disturbed on any pretext. To the surprise of
everybody, however, he suddenly resumed his functions&mdash;in
obedience, he claimed, to a Voice which said to him, 'If thou
lovest Me, feed My sheep.'<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>
But such conduct weakened his position. His enemies brought a foul
charge against him. His demand for a thorough investigation of the
libel was refused. And in his vexation he once more sought the
shelter of the Pammakaristos, abdicated the patriarchal throne, and
threw the ecclesiastical world into a turmoil.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Even then there were still some, including the
emperor, who thought order and peace would be more speedily
restored by recalling Cosmas to the office he had laid down. But
the opposition to him had become too powerful, and he was compelled
to bid farewell to the retreat he loved, and to end his days in his
native city of Sozopolis, a man worsted in battle.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 144.</i></p>

<p>Of the life at the Pammakaristos during the remainder of the
period before the Turkish conquest only a few incidents are
recorded. One abbot of the monastery, Niphon, was promoted in 1397
to the bishopric of Old Patras, and another named Theophanes was
made bishop of the important See of Heraclea. An instance of the
fickleness of fortune was brought home to the monks of the
establishment by the disgrace of the logothetes Gabalas and his
confinement in one of their cells, under the following
circumstances:&mdash;In the struggle between John Cantacuzene and
Apocaucus for ascendancy at the court of the Dowager Empress Anna
of Savoy and her son, John VI. Palaeologus, Gabalas<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> had been persuaded to join the party of the
latter politician by the offer, among other inducements, of the
hand of Apocaucus' daughter in marriage. But when Gabalas urged the
fulfilment of the promise, he was informed that the young lady and
her mother had meantime taken a violent aversion to him on account
of his corpulent figure. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145"
id="Page_145">145</a></span>Thereupon Gabalas, like a true lover,
had recourse to a method of banting recommended by an Italian
quack. But the treatment failed to reduce the flesh of the
unfortunate suitor; it only ruined his health, and made him even
less attractive than before. Another promise by which his political
support had been gained was the hope that he would share the power
which Apocaucus should win. But this Apocaucus was unwilling to
permit, alleging as an excuse that his inconvenient partisan had
become obnoxious to the empress. The disappointment and anxiety
caused by this information wore so upon the mind of the logothetes
as to alter his whole appearance. He now became thin indeed, as if
suffering from consumption, and in his dread of the storm gathering
about him he removed his valuable possessions to safe hiding.
Whereupon the wily Apocaucus drew the attention of the empress to
this strange behaviour, and aroused her suspicions that Gabalas was
engaged in some dark intrigue against her. No wonder that the
logothetes observed in consequence a marked change in the empress's
manner towards him, and in his despair he took sanctuary in S.
Sophia, and assumed the garb of a monk. The perfidy of Apocaucus
might have stopped at this point, and allowed events to follow
their natural course. But though willing to act a villain's part,
he wished to act it under the mask of a friend, to betray with a
kiss. Accordingly he went to S. Sophia to express his sympathy with
Gabalas, and played the part of a man overwhelmed with sorrow at a
friend's misfortune so well that Gabalas forgot for a while his own
griefs, and undertook the task of consoling the hypocritical
mourner. Soon an imperial messenger appeared upon the scene with
the order for Gabalas to leave the church and proceed to the
monastery of the Pammakaristos. And there he remained until, on the
charge of attempting to escape, he was confined in a stronger
prison.</p>

<p>Another person detained at the Pammakaristos was a Turkish rebel
named Zinet, who in company with a pretender to the throne of
Mehemed I., had fled in 1418 to Constantinople for protection. He
was welcomed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146"
id="Page_146">146</a></span> Byzantine Government, which was always
glad to receive refugees whom it could use either to gratify or to
embarrass the Ottoman Court, as the varying relations between the
two empires might dictate. It was a policy that proved fatal at
last, but meanwhile it often afforded some advantage to Byzantine
diplomats. On this occasion it was thought advisable to please the
Sultan, and while the pretender was confined elsewhere, Zinet, with
a suite of ten persons, was detained in the Pammakaristos. Upon the
accession of Murad II., however, the Government of Constantinople
thought proper to take the opposite course. Accordingly the
pretender was liberated, and Zinet sent to support the Turkish
party which disputed Murad's claims. But life at the Pammakaristos
had not won the refugee's heart to the cause of the Byzantines. The
fanatical monks with whom he was associated there had insulted his
faith; his Greek companions in arms did not afford him all the
satisfaction he desired, and so Zinet returned at last to his
natural allegiance. The conduct of the Byzantine Government on this
occasion led to the first siege of Constantinople, in 1422, by the
Turks.</p>

<p>The most important event in the history of the monastery
occurred after the city had fallen into Turkish hands. The church
then became the cathedral of the patriarchs of Constantinople. It
is true that, in the first instance, the conqueror had given the
church of the Holy Apostles to the Patriarch Gennadius as a
substitute for the church of S. Sophia. But the native population
did not affect the central quarters of the city, preferring to
reside near the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmora. Furthermore,
the body of a murdered Turk was discovered one morning in the court
of the Holy Apostles, and excited among his countrymen the
suspicion that the murder had been committed by a Christian hand.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> The few Greeks settled in the
neighbourhood were therefore in danger of retaliation, and
Gennadius begged permission to withdraw to the Pammakaristos,
around which a large colony of Greeks, who came from other cities
to repeople the capital, had settled.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>The objection that nuns occupied the
monastery at that moment was easily overcome by removing the
sisterhood to the small monastery attached to the church of S. John
in Trullo (Achmed Pasha Mesjedi) in the immediate vicinity,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> and for 138 years thereafter the throne of
seventeen patriarchs of Constantinople stood in the church of the
Pammakaristos, with the adjoining monastery as their official
residence.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>As the chief sanctuary of the Greek community, the building was
maintained, it would appear, in good order and displayed
considerable beauty. 'Even at night,' to quote extravagant praise,
'when no lamp was burning, it shone like the sun.' But even sober
European visitors in the sixteenth century agree in describing the
interior of the church as resplendent with eikons and imperial
portraits. It was also rich in relics, some of them brought by
Gennadius from the church of the Holy Apostles and from other
sanctuaries lost to the Greeks. Among the interesting objects shown
to visitors was a small rude sarcophagus inscribed with the
imperial eagle and the name of the Emperor Alexius Comnenus.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> It was so plain and rough that Schweigger
speaks of it as too mean to contain the dust of a German peasant.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> But that any sarcophagus professing to
hold the remains of Alexius Comnenus should be found at the
Pammakaristos is certainly surprising. That emperor was buried,
according to the historian Nicetas Choniates, in the church of S.
Saviour the Philanthropist,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
near the palace of Mangana, on the east shore of the city. Nor
could the body of a Byzantine autocrator have been laid originally
in a sarcophagus such as Bre&uuml;ning and Schweigger describe.
These difficulties in the way of regarding the monument <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>as
genuine are met by the suggestion made by Mr. Siderides, that when
the church of Christ the Philanthropist was appropriated by the
Turks in connection with the building of the Seraglio, some
patriotic hand removed the remains of Alexius Comnenus from the
splendid coffin in which they were first entombed, and, placing
them in what proved a convenient receptacle, carried them for safe
keeping to the Pammakaristos. The statement that Anna Comnena, the
celebrated daughter of Alexius Comnenus, was also buried in this
church rests upon the misunderstanding of a passage in the work of
M. Crusius, where, speaking of that princess, the author says:
'Quae (Anna) anno Domini 1117 vixit; filia Alexii Comneni Imp.
cujus sepulchrum adhuc exstat in templo patriarchatus
Constantinopli a D. Steph. Gerlachio visum.'<a name="FNanchor_242"
id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>But <i>cujus</i> (whose) refers, not to Anna, but to Alexius.
This rendering is put beyond dispute by the statement made by
Gerlach in a letter to Crusius, that he found, in the

<p>The church was converted into a mosque under Murad III.
(1574-1592), and bears the style Fetiyeh, 'of the conqueror,' in
honour of the conquest of Georgia and Azerbaijan during his reign.
According to Gerlach, the change had been feared for some time, if
for no other reason, because of the fine position occupied by the
church. But quarrels between different factions of the Greek clergy
and between them and Government officials had also something to do
with the confiscation of the building.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>Owing to the numerous additions and alterations introduced into
the original fabric, both before and since the Turkish conquest,
the original plan of the building is not immediately apparent. Nor
does the interior, with its heavy piers, raised floor, and naked
walls correspond to the accounts given of its former splendour and
beauty. A careful study will, however, unravel the tangled scheme
which the actual condition of the church presents, and detect some
traces of the beauty which has faded and passed away. The building
might be mistaken for a domed church with four aisles, two
narthexes, and a parecclesion. But notwithstanding all the
disguises due to the changes it has undergone, the original church
was unquestionably an 'ambulatory' church. It had, moreover, at one
time a third narthex, of which now only the foundations remain on
the west side of the church. The present outer narthex is in five
bays, covered by dome vaults on transverse arches, and is paved
with hexagonal tiles. The centre bay is marked by transverse arches
of greater breadth and projects slightly on the outside, forming a
plain central feature. At the north end a door led to the third
narthex, but has now been built up; at the south end is a door
inserted in Turkish times. To the south of the central bay the
exterior is treated with plain arcades in two orders of brick; to
the north these are absent, probably on account of some
alterations. At the south end the narthex returns round the church
in two bays, leading to the parecclesion.</p>

<p>The inner narthex is in four bays covered with cross-groined
vaults without transverse arches, and is at present separated from
the body of the church by three clumsy hexagonal piers, on to
which, as may be seen in the photograph (Plate <a href="#p_37">XXXVII.</a>),
the groins descend in a very irregular manner.</p>

<p>In the inner part of the church is a square central area covered
by a lofty drum-dome of twenty-four concave<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span> compartments,
alternately pierced by windows. The intermediate compartments
correspond to the piers, and the dome is therefore twelve-sided on
the exterior with angle half columns and arches in two orders.
Internally the dome arches are recessed back from the lower wall
face and spring from a heavy string-course. They were originally
pierced on the north, south, and west sides by three windows
similar to those in the west dome arch of S. Andrew (<a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>).</p>

<p>The west side is now occupied by the wooden balcony of a Turkish
house built over the narthex, but there are no indications of any
gallery in that position.</p>

<p>Below the dome arches the central area communicates with the
surrounding ambulatory on the north, west, and south sides by large
semicircular arches corbelled slightly out from the piers.</p>

<p>On the east side the dome arch is open from floor to vault, and
leads by a short bema to a five-sided space covered by a dome and
forming a kind of triangular apse, on the south-eastern side of
which is the mihrab. As is clearly shown by the character of its
dome windows and masonry, this structure is a Turkish addition
taking the place of the original three eastern apses, and is a
clever piece of planning to alter the orientation of the
building.</p>

<p>The ambulatory on the three sides of the central square is
covered by barrel vaults on the sides and with cross-groined vaults
at the angles. To the east it opened into the eastern lateral
chapels, now swept away, though the passage from the prothesis to
the central apse still remains.</p>

<p>On the north side of the church is a passage in three bays
covered by dome vaults on transverse arches, communicating at the
west end with the inner narthex, and at the east terminating in a
small chapel covered by an octagonal drum dome. The upper part of
the apse of the chapel is still visible on the exterior, but the
lower part has been destroyed and its place taken by a Turkish
window.</p>

<p>The floor of the eastern part of the church is raised a step
above the general level, this step being carried diagonally across
the floor in the centre part so as to line with the side of the
apse containing the mihrab.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>In considering the original form of the
church there is yet another important point to be noted. It will be
seen from the plan that at the ground level the central area is not
cruciform, but is rather an oblong from east to west with large
arches on the north and south sides. This oblong is, however,
reduced to a square at the dome level by arches thrown across the
east and west ends, and this, in conjunction with the setting back
of the dome arches already mentioned, produces a cruciform plan at
the springing level. The oblong character of the central area is
characteristic of the domed basilica and distinguishes this church
from S. Andrew or S. Mary Panachrantos. The employment of barrel
vaults in the ambulatory is also a point of resemblance to the
domed basilica type, though the cross groin is used on the
angles.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> In this feature S. Mary
Pammakaristos resembles S. Andrew and differs from S. Mary
Panachrantos. We are probably justified in restoring triple arcades
in all the three lower arches similar to the triple arcade which
still remains in S. Andrew. The present arches do not fit, and are
evidently later alterations for the purpose of gaining internal
space as at the Panachrantos.</p>

<p>The hexagonal piers between the ambulatory and the inner narthex
are not original, as is evident from the clumsy manner in which the
vaulting descends on to them. They are the remains of the old
western external wall of the church left over when it was pierced
through, probably in Turkish times, to include the narthex in the
interior area of the building. The piers between the ambulatory and
the gallery on the north side of the church also seem to be due to
openings made for a similar reason in the old northern wall of the
church when that gallery was added in Byzantine days. The dotted
lines on the plan show the original form of the piers and wall, as
shown by the outline of the vault springings above. The inner
narthex is later than the central church and is of inferior
workmanship. The restored plan shows the probable form of the
church at that date. The outer narthex was added at a subsequent
period.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Parecclesion.</i>&mdash;The parecclesion forms a complete
church of the 'four column' type with a narthex and gynecaeum on
the west. On the north side the two columns supporting the dome
arches have been removed, and their place is taken by a large
pointed Turkish arch which spans the chapel from east to west as is
done in the north church of the Panachrantos (<a href="#Page_129">p. 129</a>). The southern columns are of green marble
with bases of a darker marble and finely carved capitals both
bedded in lead. One of these columns, that to the east, has been
partly built into the mihrab wall. The arms of the cross and the
western angle compartments are covered with cross-groined vaults,
while the eastern angle compartments have dome vaults. The bema and
the two lateral chapels have cross-groined vaults. As usual the
apse is semicircular within and shows to the exterior seven
sides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> the three centre sides being filled with
a triple window with carved oblong shafts and cubical capitals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="fig_47" id="fig_47"></a>
<img class="noborder" src="images/fig_47.png" width="500" height="447"
alt="Plan of the Church (conjectural)." title="" />
 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47</span></p>
</div>

<p>Internally the church is divided by string-courses at the abacus
level of the columns and at the springing level of the vaults into
three stories. The lowest story is now pierced by Turkish windows
but was originally plain; the middle story is pierced by
single-light windows in each of the angle compartments, and in the
cross arm by a three-light window of two quarter arches and a
central high semicircular arch, similar to those in the narthex of
the Chora. The highest story has a single large window in the cross
arm.</p>

<p>To the east the bema arch springs from the abacus level and all
three apses have low vaults, a somewhat unusual arrangement. This
allows of an east window in the tympanum of the dome arch above the
bema.</p>

<p>The dome is in twelve bays, each pierced by a window and
separated by flat projecting ribs. It retains its mosaics,
representing Christ in the centre surrounded by twelve prophets.
Each prophet holds in his hand a scroll inscribed with a
characteristic quotation from his writings. The drawing, for which
I am indebted to the skill and kindness of Mr. Arthur E. Henderson,
gives an excellent idea of the scheme of the mosaics.</p>

<p>Speaking of these mosaics, Diehl remarks that we have here, as
in the Chora, indications of the Revival of Art in the fourteenth
century. The Christ in the centre of the dome is no longer
represented as the stern and hard Pantokrator, but shows a
countenance of infinite benignity and sweetness. The twelve
prophets grouped around Him in the flutings of the dome reveal, in
the variety of their expressions, in their different attitudes, in
the harmonious colours and elegant draping of their robes, an
artist who seeks to escape from traditional types and create a
living work of his own.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>The narthex is in three bays covered by cross-groined vaults
without transverse arches. The lower window is a Turkish insertion,
and above it, rising from the vaulting <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>string-course at the
level of the abacus course in the church, is a triple window of the
type already described.<br />
<br />

 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48</span><br />
 <small>(For other details see Fig. <a href="#fig_68">68.</a>)</small></p></div>

<p>Above the narthex and approached by a narrow stair in the
thickness of the west wall is the small gynecaeum. It is in three
bays, separated by strong transverse arches resting on pilasters,
each bay having a deep recess to east and west. The centre bay is
covered by a cross-groined <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155">155</a></span>vault, and overlooks the church by a
small window pierced in the west cross arm. Each of the side bays
is covered by a drum dome of sixteen concave bays pierced with
eight windows and externally octagonal. The plaster has fallen away
from these bays, allowing us to see that they are built in regular
courses of brick with thick mortar joints and without any special
strengthening at the lines of juncture or ribs between the
compartments. Such domes, therefore, are not strictly ribbed domes
but rather domes in compartments. The 'ribs' no doubt do, by their
extra thickness, add to the strength of the vault, but here, as in
most Byzantine domes, their purpose is primarily ornamental.</p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 154.</i></p>

<p>The exterior of the chapel, like the fa&ccedil;ade of S.
Theodore (p. <a href="#Page_247">247</a>), presents a carefully
considered scheme of decoration, characteristic of the later
Byzantine school both here and in the later schools outside
Constantinople. The southern wall is divided externally as it is
also internally, into three stories, and forms two main
compartments corresponding to the narthex and to the cross arm.
They are marked by high arches of two orders, which enclose two
triple windows in the upper story of the narthex and of the cross
arm. The clue to the composition is given by the middle story,
which contains the two large triple windows of the narthex and of
the cross arm, and the two single lights of the angle compartment,
one on each side of the cross arm triple light. These windows are
enclosed in brick arches of two orders and linked together by
semicircular arched niches, of which those flanking the narthex
window are slightly larger than the rest, thus giving a continuous
arcade of a very pleasant rhythmic quality.</p>

<p>In the lower story the piers of the arches round the triple
windows are alone carried down through the inscribed string-course
which separates the stories and forms the window-sill. The system
of niches is repeated, flat niches being substituted for the angle
compartment windows above.</p>

<p>The highest story contains the large single windows which light
the cross arm and the gynecaeum, the former flanked by two
semicircular niches, the latter by two<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span> brick roundels with
radiating joints. Between them, above the west angle compartment
window, is a flat niche with a Turkish arch. It is possible that
there was originally a break here extending to the cornice, and
that this was filled up during Turkish repairs. The cornice has two
ranges of brick dentils and is arched over the two large windows.
The domes on the building have flat angle pilasters supporting an
arched cornice.</p>

<p>The masonry is in stripes of brick and stone courses, with
radiating joints to the arched niches and a zigzag pattern in the
spandrils of the first-story arches. At this level are four carved
stone corbels with notches on the upper side, evidently to take a
wooden beam. These must have supported the roof of an external wood
cloister. The inscribed string-course already mentioned between the
ground and first stories bears a long epitaph in honour of Michael
Glabas Tarchaniotes.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> (<a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49.</a>)</p>

<p>The three apses at the east end are of equal height. The side
ones are much worn but were apparently plain. The centre apse is in
three stories with alternately flat and circular niches in each
side. It is crowned by a machicolated cornice similar to that on
the east end of S. Theodosia.</p>

<p>The general composition, as will be seen from the description,
arises very directly from the internal arrangements of the chapel
and is extremely satisfactory. The ranges of arches, varying in a
manner at first irregular, but presently seen to be perfectly
symmetrical, give a rhythmic swing to the design. The walls are now
heavily plastered and the effect of the horizontal bands of brick
and stone is lost; but even in its present state the building is a
very delightful example of Byzantine external architecture.</p>

<p>Evidently the foundress of the chapel wished the monument she
reared to her husband's memory to be as beautiful both within and
without as the taste and skill of the times could make it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>What information we have in regard to the
chapel is little, but clear and definite, resting as it does on the
authority of the two epitaphs which the poet Philes composed to be
inscribed on the interior and exterior walls of the building. One
of the epitaphs, if ever placed in position, has been destroyed or
lies concealed under Turkish plaster. Of the other only fragments
remain, forming part of the scheme of decoration which adorns the
south wall of the chapel. But fortunately the complete text of both
epitaphs is preserved in the extant writings of their author, and
affords all the information they were meant to record. The chapel
was dedicated to Christ as the Logos<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
and was built after the death of the protostrator by his wife
Maria, or Martha in religion, for a mausoleum in which to place his
tomb.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> As the protostrator died
about 1315, the chapel was erected soon after that date. An
interesting incident occurred in this chapel soon after <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>the
Turkish conquest. One day when the Sultan was riding through his
newly acquired capital he came to the Pammakaristos, and upon being
informed that it was the church assigned to the Patriarch
Gennadius, alighted to honour the prelate with a visit. The meeting
took place in this parecclesion, and the conversation, of which a
summary account was afterwards sent to the Sultan, dwelt on the
dogmas of the Christian Faith.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a>

182-89. When Cosmas was appointed patriarch a curious incident
occurred. A monk of the monastery of the Pantepoptes protested
against the nomination, because it had been revealed to him that
the person who should fill the vacant office would bear the name
John. Such was the impression made by this prediction that matters
were so arranged that somehow Cosmas was able to claim that name
also. Whereupon the monk went on to predict how many years Cosmas
would hold office, and that he would lose that position before his
death.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. THEODOSIA, GUL JAMISSI</h4>

<p>There can be no doubt that the mosque Gul Jamissi (mosque of the
Rose), that stands within the Gate Aya Kapou, near the Golden Horn,
was the Byzantine church of S. Theodosia. For Aya Kapou is the
entrance styled in Byzantine days the Gate of S. Theodosia
(&pi;&#8059;&lambda;&eta; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&#7937;&gamma;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;),
because in the immediate vicinity of the church of that
dedication.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> This was also the view
current on the subject when Gyllius<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>
and Gerlach<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> visited the city in the
sixteenth century. The Turkish epithet of the gate 'Aya,' Holy, is
thus explained. Du Cange,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>
contrary to all evidence, places the church of S. Theodosia on the
northern side of the harbour, or at its head, <i>ultra
sinum</i>.</p>

<p>The saint is celebrated in ecclesiastical history for her
opposition to the iconoclastic policy of Leo the Isaurian. For when
that emperor commanded the eikon of Christ over the Bronze Gate of
the Great Palace to be removed, Theodosia, at the head of a band of
women, rushed to the spot and overthrew the ladder up which the
officer, charged with the execution of the imperial order, was
climbing to reach the image. In the fall the officer was killed.
Whereupon a rough soldier seized Theodosia, and dragging her to the
forum of the Bous (Ak Serai), struck her dead by driving a ram's
horn through her neck. Naturally, when the cause for which she
sacrificed her life triumphed, she was honoured <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>as a
martyr, and men said, 'The ram's horn, in killing thee, O
Theodosia, appeared to thee a new Horn of Amalthea.'<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a>

<p>The remains of the martyred heroine were taken for burial to the
monastery of Dexiocrates (&tau;&#8056;
&mu;&omicron;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&#8053;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
&tau;&#8056;
&#8000;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&zeta;&#8057;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;
&Delta;&epsilon;&xi;&iota;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&#8049;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;),
so named either after its founder or after the district in which it
was situated.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> This explains why the Gate
of S. Theodosia was also designated the Gate of Dexiocrates
(&Pi;&#8057;&rho;&tau;&alpha;
&Delta;&epsilon;&xi;&iota;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&#8049;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;).<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> The earliest reference to the church of S.
Theodosia occurs in the account of the pilgrimage made by Anthony,
Archbishop of Novgorod,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>
to Constantinople in 1200. Alluding to that shrine he says: 'Dans
un couvent,' to quote the French translation of his narrative, 'de
femmes se trouvent les reliques de sainte Th&eacute;odosie, dans
une ch&acirc;sse ouverte en argent.' Another Russian pilgrim from
Novgorod,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> Stephen, who was in
Constantinople in 1350, refers to the convent expressly as the
convent of S. Theodosia: 'Nous all&acirc;mes v&eacute;n&eacute;rer
la sainte vierge Th&eacute;odosie, que (p&eacute;cheurs) nous
bais&acirc;mes; il y a l&agrave; un couvent en son nom au bord de
la mer.' The convent is again mentioned in the description of
Constantinople by the Russian pilgrim<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>
who visited the city shortly before the Turkish conquest (1424-53).
'De l&agrave; (Blachernae) nous nous dirige&acirc;mes vers l'est et
atteign&icirc;mes le couvent de Sainte Th&eacute;odosie; la sainte
vierge Th&eacute;odosie y repose dans une ch&acirc;sse
d&eacute;couverte.'</p>

<p>Two other Russian pilgrims, Alexander the scribe (1395), and the
deacon Zosimus (1419-21), likewise refer to the relics of the
saint, but they do so in terms which create some difficulty.
Alexander saw the relics in the church of the Pantokrator,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> while Zosimus found them in the convent of the
'Everghetis.'<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> The discrepancy between
these statements may indeed be explained as one of the mistakes
very easily committed by strangers who spend only a short time in a
city, visit a multitude of similar objects during that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>brief
stay, and write the account of their travels at hurried moments, or
after returning home.</p>

<p>It is on this principle that Mordtmann<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>
deals with the statement that the relics of S. Theodosia were kept
in the monastery of the 'Everghetis.' In his opinion Zosimus
confused the monastery of S. Saviour Euergetes<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> with the church of S. Theodosia,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> because of the proximity of the two sanctuaries.
Lapses of memory are of course possible, but, on the other hand,
the trustworthiness of a document must not be brushed aside too
readily.</p>

<p>But the differences in the statements of the Russian pilgrims,
as to the particular church in which the relics of S. Theodosia
were enshrined, may be explained without charging any of the good
men with a mistake, if we remember that relics of the same saint
might be preserved in several sanctuaries; that the calendar of the
Greek church celebrates four saints bearing the name Theodosia;<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> and, lastly, that churches of the same
dedication stood in different quarters of the city. In fact, a
church dedicated to the Theotokos Euergetes stood on the Xerolophos
above the quarter of Psamathia.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<p>Stephen of Novgorod<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>
makes it perfectly clear that he venerated the relics of S.
Theodosia in two different sanctuaries of the city, one of them
being a church beside the Golden Horn, the other standing on the
heights above Psamathia. So does the anonymous pilgrim.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> The scribe Alexander<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
found the relics of S. Theodosia both in the Pantokrator and in the
church of Kirmarta, above the quarter of Psamathia. It is clear,
therefore, that Zosimus,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a>
who places the relics of S. Theodosia in the monastery of
'Everghetis,' has in mind the church of the Theotokos Euergetes
above Psamathia, and not the church of S. <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>Saviour Euergetes which
stood near S. Theodosia beside the Golden Horn.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>While Zosimus and Alexander agree in placing the relics of S.
Theodosia in a church in the region of Psamathia, they differ as to
the name of that church, the former naming it Everghetis, while the
latter styles it Kirmarta. As appears from statements found on
pages 108, 163, 205 of the <i>Itin&eacute;raires russes</i>, the
two sanctuaries were closely connected. But however this
discrepancy should be treated, there can be no doubt that relics of
S. Theodosia were exhibited, not only in the church dedicated to
her beside the Golden Horn, but also in a church in the
south-western part of the city. Nor can it be doubted that a church
in the latter quarter was dedicated to the Theotokos Euergetes.</p>
</div>

<p>That several churches should have claimed to possess the relics
of the heroine who championed the cause of eikons, assuming that
all the Russian pilgrims had one and the same S. Theodosia in mind,
is not strange. Many other popular saints were honoured in a
similar fashion.</p>

<p>The shrine of S. Theodosia was famed for miraculous cures. Her
horn of plenty was filled with gifts of healing. Twice a week, on
Wednesdays and Fridays, according to Stephen of Novgorod, or on
Mondays and Fridays, according to another pilgrim, the relics of
the saint were carried in procession and laid upon sick and
impotent folk.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Those were days of high
festival. All the approaches to the church were packed with men and
women eager to witness the wonders performed. Patients representing
almost every complaint to which human flesh is heir filled the
court. Gifts of oil and money poured into the treasury; the church
was a blaze of lighted tapers; the prayers were long; the chanting
was loud. Meanwhile the sufferers were borne one after another to
the sacred relics, 'and whoever was sick,' says the devout Stephen,
'was healed.' So profound was the impression caused by one of these
cures in 1306, that Pachymeres<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a>
considered it his duty, as the historian of his day, to record the
wonder; and his example may be followed to furnish an illustration
of the beliefs and usages <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168"
id="Page_168">168</a></span>which bulked largely in the religious
life witnessed in the churches of Byzantine Constantinople.</p>

<p>At the time referred to there dwelt in the city a deaf-mute, a
well-known object of charity who supported himself by petty
services in benevolent households. While thus employed by a family
that resided near the church of the Holy Apostles, the poor man one
night saw S. Theodosia in a dream, and heard her command to repair
with tapers and incense to the church dedicated to her honour. Next
morning the deaf-mute made his friends understand what had occurred
during his sleep, and with their help found his way to the
designated shrine. There he was anointed with the holy oil of the
lamp before the saint's eikon, and bowed long in humble adoration
at her feet. Nothing remarkable happened at the time. But on his
homeward way the devout man felt a strange pain in his ear, and
upon putting his hand to the sore place, what seemed a winged
insect flew out and vanished from view. Wondering what this might
mean, he entered the house in which he served, and set himself to
prepare the oven in which the bread for the family was to be baked
that day. But all his efforts to kindle the fire were in vain; the
wood only smoked. This went on so long that, like most persons
under the same circumstances, the much-tried man lost his temper
and gave way to the impulse to use bad language. Whereupon sonorous
imprecations on the obstinate fuel shook the air. The bystanders
could not believe their ears. They thought the sounds proceeded
from some mysterious voice in the oven. But the deaf-mute protested
that he heard his friends talking, and assured them that the words
they heard were his own; S. Theodosia had opened his ears and
loosed his tongue. The news of the marvel spread far and wide and
reached even the court. Andronicus II. sent for the young man,
interrogated him, and was so deeply impressed by the recital of
what had happened that he determined to proceed to the church of S.
Theodosia in state, and went thither with the patriarch and the
senate, humbly on foot, and spent the whole night before the
wonder-working shrine in prayer and thanksgiving.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>The last scene witnessed in this church as
a Christian sanctuary was pathetic in the extreme. It was the vigil
of the day sacred to the memory of the saint, May 29, 1453. The
siege of the city by the Turks had reached its crisis. The morning
light would see the Queen of Cities saved or lost. All hearts were
torn with anxiety, and the religious fervour of the population rose
to the highest pitch. Already, in the course of the previous day, a
great procession had gone through the streets of the city, invoking
the aid of God and of all His saints. The emperor and the leading
personages of his court were in S. Sophia, praying, weeping,
embracing one another, forgiving one another, all feeling oppressed
by a sense of doom. In the terrible darkness the church of S.
Theodosia, ablaze with lighted tapers, gleamed like a beacon of
hope. An immense congregation, including many women, filled the
building, and prayers ascended to Heaven with unwonted
earnestness&mdash;when suddenly the tramp of soldiers and strange
shouts were heard. Had the city indeed fallen? The entrance of
Turkish troops into the church removed all doubt, and the men and
women who had gathered to pray for deliverance were carried off as
prisoners of war.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> According to the
<i>Belgic Chronicle</i>, the body of the saint and other relics
were thrown into the mire and cast to the dogs.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>As the building has undergone extensive repairs since it became
a mosque, care must be taken to distinguish between the original
features of the fabric and Turkish changes and restorations. The
pointed dome arches rest on pilasters built against the internal
angles of the cross. The dome is windowless, has no internal drum,
and externally is octagonal with a low drum and a flat cornice.
Dome, arches, and pilasters are all evidently Turkish
reconstructions. The gable walls of the transepts and the western
wall are also Turkish. As the central apse coincided with the
orientation of the mosque, it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>has retained its original
form and some portions of its Byzantine walls, but it also has
suffered Turkish alterations. The cross arches in the south gallery
and in the narthex are pointed, and, in their present form,
unquestionably Turkish; but as the vault above them is Byzantine,
their form may be due to cutting away in order to secure a freer
passage round the galleries for the convenience of Moslem
worshippers. The outer narthex is Turkish, but the old wall which
forms its foundation and traces of an old pavement imply the former
existence of a Byzantine narthex. In spite, however, of these
serious changes the building preserves its original characteristic
features, and is a good example of a domed-cross church, with
galleries on three sides and domes over the four
angle-chambers.</p>

<p>The galleries rest on a triple arcade supported by square piers.
On the north and south the aisles are covered with cross-groined
vaults on oblong compartments, while the passage or narthex under
the western gallery has a barrel vault.</p>

<p>The chambers at the north-eastern and south-eastern angles of
the cross are thrown into the side chapels, which thus consist of
two bays covered with cross-groined vaults. Communication between
the chapels and the bema was maintained by passages opening in the
ordinary fashion into the eastern bays.</p>

<p>In the thickness of each of the eastern dome piers, and at a
short distance above the floor, is a small chamber. The chamber in
the north-eastern pier is lighted by a small opening looking
southwards, and was reached by a door in the east side of the
passage leading from the bema to the north-eastern chapel. The door
has been walled up, and the chamber is consequently inaccessible.
The chamber in the south-eastern pier is lighted by a window
looking northwards, and has a door in the east side of the passage
from the bema to the south-eastern chapel.</p>

<p>Over the door is a Turkish inscription<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>
in gilt letters to this effect, 'Tomb of the Apostles, disciples of
Jesus. Peace to him.' The chamber is reached by a short spiral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>stairway of nine stone steps, and contains
a small marble tomb, which is covered with shawls, and has a turban
around its headstone. On a bracket in the wall is a lamp ready to
be lighted in honour of the deceased. The roof of the chamber is
perforated by an opening that runs into the floor at the east end
of the southern gallery, and over the opening is an iron
grating.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Access to the galleries is gained by means of a staircase in the
northern bay of the passage under the western gallery. For some
distance from the floor of the church the staircase has wooden
steps, but from the first landing, where a door in the northern
wall stands on a level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span> with the ground outside the church, stone
steps are employed for the remainder of the way up. The wooden
steps are Turkish, but may replace Byzantine steps of the same
material. The stone steps are Byzantine, and could be reached
directly from outside the church through the door situated beside
the landing from which they start. Probably in Byzantine days the
stone staircase could not be reached from the floor of the church,
and furnished the only means of access to the galleries.</p>

<p>The galleries are covered by the barrel vaults of the cross
arms. At the east end of the northern and the southern gallery are
chapels covered with domes and placed above the prothesis and the
diaconicon. As stated already, the aperture in the roof of the
chamber in the south-eastern dome pier opens into the floor of the
southern chapel, and probably a similar aperture in the roof of the
corresponding chamber in the north-eastern pier opened into the
floor of the chapel at the east end of the northern gallery. The
presence of chapels in such an unusual position is explained by the
desire to celebrate special services in honour of the saints whose
remains were buried in the chambers in the piers, as though in
crypts.</p>

<p>The domes over the chapels are hemispherical and rest directly
on the pendentives. They are ribless and without drums. The arches
on which they rest are semicircular and, with their infilling of
triple windows, are Byzantine. We may safely set down all four
angle domes as belonging to the original design, though the arches
by which they communicate with the galleries are pointed, and are
therefore Turkish insertions or enlargements.</p>

<p>On the exterior the eastern wall of the church is fairly well
preserved. The three apses project boldly; the central apse in
seven sides, the lateral apses in three sides. Although the central
apse is unquestionably a piece of Byzantine work it does not appear
to be the original apse of the building, but a substitute inserted
in the course of repairs before the Turkish conquest. This accounts
for its plain appearance as compared with the lateral apses, which
are decorated with four tiers of five niches, corre- <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>sponding
to the window height and the vaulting-level within the church. As
on the apses of the Pantokrator (p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>)
the niches are shallow segments in plan, set back in one brick
order, and without impost moulding. In the lowest tier three arches
are introduced between pilasters, with a window in the central
arch. Above the four tiers of niches is a boldly corbelled cornice,
like that in the chapel attached to the Pammakaristos. One cannot
help admiring how an effect so decidedly rich and beautiful was
produced by very simple means.</p>

<p>For some time after the conquest the building was used as a
naval store.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> It was converted into a
mosque in the reign of Sultan Selim II. (1566-74) by a wealthy
courtier, Hassan Pasha, and was known as Hassan Pasha Mesjedi.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> Its title, the mosque of the Rose,
doubtless refers to its beauty, just as another mosque is, for a
similar reason, styled Laleli Jamissi, the mosque of the Tulip.</p>

<p>Before leaving the church we may consider the claims of the
tradition that the chamber in the south-eastern dome pier contains
the tomb of the last Byzantine emperor. The tradition was first
announced to the general public by the Patriarch Constantius in a
letter which he addressed in 1852 to Mr. Scarlatus Byzantius, his
fellow-student in all pertaining to the antiquities and history of
Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> According to the
patriarch, the tradition was accepted by the Turkish ecclesiastical
authorities of the city, and was current among the old men of the
Greek community resident in the quarter of Phanar; he himself knew
the tradition even in his boyhood. Furthermore, distinguished
European visitors who inquired for Byzantine imperial tombs were
directed by Turkish officials to the church of S. Theodosia, as the
resting-place of the emperor who died with the Empire; and the
inscription over the door of the chamber referred to that champion
of the Greek cause. Strangely enough, the patriarch said nothing
about this tradition when treating of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>the church of S.
Theodosia in his book on <i>Ancient and Modern Constantinople</i>,
published in 1844. In that work, indeed, he assigns the tomb in
question to some martyr who suffered during the iconoclastic
period.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> This strange silence he
explains in his letter written in 1852 as due to prudence; he had
reason then to 'put the seal of Alexander upon his lips.'</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span><br />
 <small>(For other details in the church see Fig. <a href="#fig_76">76.</a>)</small></p></div>

<p>The tradition has recently received the honour of being
supported by Mr. Siderides, to whom students of Byzantine
archaeology are so deeply indebted. But while accepting it in
general, Mr. Siderides thinks it is open to correction on two
points of detail.</p>

<p>In his opinion the church of S. Theodosia was not the first
sanctuary to guard the mortal remains of Constantine Palaeologus,
but the second. Nor was the body of the fallen hero, when
ultimately brought to this church, placed, as the <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>patriarch
supposed, in the chamber in the south-eastern pier, but in the
chamber in the pier to the north-east. The reasons urged in favour
of these modifications of the tradition, as reported by the
Patriarch Constantius, are substantially the following:&mdash;In
the first place, the body of the last Constantine, after its
decapitation, was, at the express order of the victorious Sultan,
buried with royal honours, &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#8048;
&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&iota;&kappa;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&tau;&iota;&mu;&#8134;&sigmaf;,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>
and therefore, so Mr. Siderides maintains, must have been interred
in the church which then enjoyed the highest rank in the Greek
community of the city, viz. the church of the Holy Apostles, the
patriarchal cathedral after the appropriation of S. Sophia by the
Turks. The church of the Holy Apostles, however, soon lost that
distinction, and was torn down to make room for the mosque which
bears the name of the conqueror of the city. Under these
circumstances what more natural, asks Mr. Siderides, than that
pious and patriotic hands should remove as many objects of
historical or religious value as possible from the doomed shrine,
and deposit them where men might still do them
reverence&mdash;especially when there was every facility for the
removal of such objects, owing to the fact that a Christian
architect, Christoboulos, had charge of the destruction of the
church and of the erection of the mosque.</p>

<p>Some of those objects were doubtless transferred to the church
of the Pammakaristos,<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>
where the Patriarch Gennadius placed his throne after abandoning
the church of the Holy Apostles; but others may have been taken
elsewhere. And for proof that the church of S. Theodosia had the
honour of being entrusted with the care of some of the relics
removed from the Holy Apostles, Mr. Siderides points to the
inscription over the doorway leading to the chamber in the
south-eastern dome pier. According to the inscription that chamber
is consecrated by the remains of Christ's apostles, <i>i.e.</i> the
relics which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a>
</span>formed the peculiar treasure of the church
of the Holy Apostles.</p>

<p>This being so, Mr. Siderides argues, on the strength of the
tradition under review, that the remains of the last Constantine
also were brought from the church of the Holy Apostles to S.
Theodosia under the circumstances described.</p>

<p>As to the position of the imperial tomb when thus transferred to
the church of S. Theodosia, Mr. Siderides insists that it cannot be
in the chamber in the south-eastern dome pier: first, because the
religious veneration cherished by Moslems for the grave in that
chamber is inconsistent with the idea that the grave contains the
ashes of the enemy who, in 1453, resisted the Sultan's attack upon
the city; secondly, because the inscription over the doorway
leading to the chamber expressly declares the chamber to be the
resting-place of Christ's apostles. Hence Mr. Siderides concludes
that if the tradition before us has any value, the tomb of the last
Byzantine emperor was placed in the chamber in the north-eastern
pier, and finds confirmation of that view in the absence of any
respect for the remains deposited there.</p>

<p>To enter into a minute criticism of this tradition and of the
arguments urged in its support would carry us far beyond our scope.
Nor does such criticism seem necessary. The fact that the last
Constantine was buried with royal honours affords no proof whatever
that he was laid to rest in the church of the Holy Apostles. If he
was ever buried in S. Theodosia, he may have been buried there from
the first. The lateness of the date when the tradition became
public makes the whole story it tells untrustworthy. Before a
statement published in the early part of the nineteenth century in
regard to the interment of the last Byzantine emperor can have any
value, it must be shown to rest on information furnished nearer the
time at which the alleged event occurred. No information of that
kind has been produced. On the contrary, the only contemporary
historian of the siege of 1453 who refers to the site of the
emperor's grave informs us that the head of the last Constantine
was interred in S. Sophia, and his mutilated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span> body in
Galata.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> The patriarchal
authorities of the sixteenth century, as Mr. Siderides admits,
while professing to point out the exact spot where Constantine
Palaeologus fell, were ignorant of the place where he was buried.
In his work on the mosques of the city, written in 1620, Evlia
Effendi not only knows nothing of the tradition we are considering,
but says expressly that the emperor was buried elsewhere&mdash;in
the church of the monastery of S. Mary Peribleptos, known by the
Turks as Soulou Monastir, in the quarter of Psamathia. In 1852 a
story prevailed that the grave of the last Constantine was in the
quarter of Vefa Meidan.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>
From all these discrepancies it is evident that in the confusion
attending the Turkish capture of the city, the real site of the
imperial grave was soon forgotten, and that all subsequent
indications of its position are mere conjectures, the offspring of
the propensity to find in nameless graves local habitations for
popular heroes.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The first edition of <i>Ancient and Modern Constantinople</i>
was published in 1824. In it there is no mention of any tomb in the
church of S. Theodosia. The second edition of that work appeared in
1844, and there the author speaks of a tomb in the church, and
suggests that it was the tomb of some martyr in the iconoclastic
persecution. The patriarch's letter to Scarlatus Byzantius was
written in 1852, and published by the latter in 1862. In that
letter the patriarch reports for the first time the tradition that
the tomb in S. Theodosia was the tomb of Constantine Palaeologus.
In 1851 a Russian visitor to Constantinople, Andrew Mouravieff, who
published an account of his travels, says that in the church of S.
Theodosia he was shown a tomb which the officials of the mosque
assured him was the tomb of the last Christian emperor of the
city.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Lastly, but not least, in
1832 the church of S. Theodosia underwent repairs at the Sultan's
orders, and then a neglected <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>tomb was discovered in the
church by the Christian architect who had charge of the work of
restoration, Haji Stephen Gaitanaki Maditenou (see letter of the
patriarch).<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> It is difficult to resist
the impression that the discovery of the tomb at that time gave
occasion for the fanciful conjectures current among Turks and
Greeks in regard to the body interred in the tomb. See the article
of Mr. Siderides, who gives the facts just mentioned, without
drawing the inference I have suggested.<br />

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARY DIACONISSA, KALENDER HANEH JAMISSI</h4>

<p>Close to the eastern end of the aqueduct of Valens, and to the
south of it, in the quarter of the mosque Shahzad&eacute;, is a
beautiful Byzantine church, now known as Kalender Haneh Jamissi. It
was visited by Gyllius,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
who refers to its beautiful marble revetment&mdash;<i>vestita
crustis varii marmoris</i>&mdash;but has, unfortunately, nothing to
say concerning its dedication. Since that traveller's time the very
existence of the church was forgotten by the Greek community of
Constantinople until Paspates<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> discovered the building in 1877. But even that
indefatigable explorer of the ancient remains of the city could not
get access to the interior, and it was reserved for Dr. Freshfield
in 1880 to be the first European visitor since Gyllius to enter the
building, and make its interest and beauty known to the general
public.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a>

<p>The identity of the church is a matter of pure conjecture, for
we have no tradition or documentary evidence on that point.
Paspates<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> suggests that it may have
been the sanctuary connected either with the 'monastery of Valens
and Daudatus,' or with the 'monastery near the aqueduct,'
establishments in existence before the age of Justinian the
Great.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> It cannot be the former,
because the monastery of Valens and Daudatus, which was dedicated
to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>S. John the Baptist, stood near the church
of the Holy Apostles close to the western end of the aqueduct of
Valens. It might, so far as the indication 'near the aqueduct'
gives any clue, be the sanctuary of the latter House, in which case
the church was dedicated to S. Anastasius.<a name="FNanchor_298"
id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> But the architectural features of Kalender Haneh
Jamissi do not belong to the period before Justinian. Mordtmann<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> identifies the building with the church of
the Theotokos in the district of the Deaconess
(&nu;&alpha;&#8056;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&#8057;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;
&tau;&#8048;
&Delta;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&#8055;&sigma;&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf;),
and in favour of this view there is the fact that the site of the
mosque corresponds, speaking broadly, to the position which that
church is known to have occupied somewhere between the forum of
Taurus (now represented by the Turkish War Office) and the
Philadelphium (the area about the mosque of Shahzad&eacute;), and
not far off the street leading to the Holy Apostles. Furthermore,
the rich and beautiful decoration of the church implies its
importance, so that it may very well be the church of the Theotokos
Diaconissa, at which imperial processions from the Great Palace to
the Holy Apostles stopped to allow the emperor to place a lighted
taper upon the altar of the shrine.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>Theophanes,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> the earliest writer to
mention the church of the Diaconissa, ascribes its foundation to
the Patriarch Kyriakos (593-605) in the fourth year of his
patriarchate, during the reign of the Emperor Maurice. According to
the historical evidence at our command, that church was therefore
erected towards the close of the sixth century. Dr. Freshfield,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> however, judging by the form of the church
and the character of the dome, thinks that Kalender Haneh Jamissi
is 'not earlier than the eighth century, and not later than the
tenth.' Lethaby<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> places it in the
period between Justinian the Great and the eleventh century. 'The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>church, now the Kalender mosque of
Constantinople, probably belongs to the intermediate period. The
similar small cruciform church of Protaton, Mount Athos, is dated
c. 950.' Hence if Theophanes and his followers are not to clash
with these authorities on architecture, either Kalender Haneh
Jamissi is not the church of the Diaconissa, or it is a
reconstruction of the original fabric of that sanctuary. To restore
an old church was not an uncommon practice in Constantinople, and
Kalender Haneh Jamissi has undoubtedly seen changes in the course
of its history. On the other hand, Diehl is of the opinion that the
building cannot be later than the seventh century and may be
earlier.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The church belongs to the domed-cross type. The central area is
cruciform, with barrel vaults over the arms and a dome on the
centre. As the arms are not filled in with galleries this cruciform
plan is very marked internally. Four small chambers, in two
stories, in the arm angles bring the building to the square form
externally. The upper stories are inaccessible except by ladders,
but the supposition that they ever formed, like the similar stories
in the dome piers of S. Sophia, portions of continuous galleries
along the northern, western, and southern walls of the church is
precluded by the character of the revetment on the walls. In the
development of the domed-cross type, the church stands logically
intermediate between the varieties of that type found respectively
in the church of S. Theodosia and in that of SS. Peter and
Mark.</p>

<p>The lower story of the north-western pier is covered with a flat
circular roof resting on four pendentives, while the upper story is
open to the timbers, and rises higher than the roof of the church,
as though it were the base of some kind of tower. It presents no
indications of pendentives or of a start in vaulting. The original
eastern wall of the church has been almost totally torn down and
replaced by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a>
</span>a straight wall of Turkish construction.
Traces of three apses at that end of the building can, however,
still be discerned; for the points at which the curve of the
central apse started are visible on either side of the Turkish
wall, and the northern apse shows on the exterior. The northern and
southern walls are lighted by large triple windows, divided by
shafts and descending to a marble parapet near the floor (Plate <a href="#p_4">IV.</a>).
The dome, which is large in proportion to
the church, is a polygon of sixteen sides. It rests directly on
pendentives, but has a comparatively high external drum above the
roof. It is pierced by sixteen windows which follow the curve of
the dome. The flat, straight external cornice above them is
Turkish, and there is good reason to suspect that the dome, taken
as a whole, is Turkish work, for it strongly resembles the Turkish
domes found in S. Theodosia, SS. Peter and Mark, and S. Andrew in
Krisei. The vaults, moreover, below the dome are very much
distorted; and the pointed eastern arch like the eastern wall
appears to be Turkish. When portions of the building so closely
connected with the dome have undergone Turkish repairs, it is not
strange that the dome itself should also have received similar
treatment.</p>

<p>In the western faces of the piers that carry the eastern arch
large marble frames of considerable beauty are inserted. The sills
are carved and rest on two short columns; two slender pilasters of
verd antique form the sides; and above them is a flat cornice
enriched with overhanging leaves of acanthus and a small bust in
the centre. Within the frames is a large marble slab. Dr.
Freshfield thinks these frames formed part of the eikonostasis, but
on that view the bema would have been unusually large. The more
probable position of the eikonostasis was across the arch nearer
the apse. In that case the frames just described formed part of the
general decoration of the building, although, at the same time,
they may have enclosed isolated eikons. Eikons in a similar
position are found in S. Saviour in the Chora (Plate <a href="#p_86">LXXXVI.</a>).</p>

<p>The marble casing of the church is remarkably fine. Worthy of
special notice is the careful manner in which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>the
colours and veinings of the marble slabs are made to correspond and
match. The zigzag inlaid pattern around the arches also deserves
particular attention. High up in the western wall, and reached by
the wooden stairs leading to a Turkish wooden gallery on that side
of the church, are two marble slabs with a door carved in
bas-relief upon them. They may be symbols of Christ as the door of
His fold (Plate <a href="#p_4">IV.</a>).</p>

<p>The church has a double narthex. As the ground outside the
building has been raised enormously (it rises 15-20 feet above the
floor at the east end) the actual entrance to the outer narthex is
through a cutting in its vault or through a window, and the floor
is reached by a steep flight of stone steps. The narthex is a long
narrow vestibule, covered with barrel vaults, and has a Turkish
wooden ceiling at the southern end.</p>

<p>The esonarthex is covered with a barrel vault between two cross
vaults. The entrance into the church stands between two Corinthian
columns, but they belong to different periods, and do not
correspond to any structure in the building. In fact, both
narthexes have been much altered in their day, presenting many
irregularities and containing useless pilasters.</p>

<p>Professor Goodyear refers to this church in support of the
theory that in Byzantine buildings there is an intentional widening
of the structure from the ground upwards. 'It will also be
observed,' he says, 'that the cornice is horizontal, whereas the
marble casing above and below the cornice is cut and fitted in
oblique lines.... The outward bend on the right side of the choir
is 11<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches in 33 feet. The masonry surfaces step back above
the middle string-course. That these bends are not due to thrust is
abundantly apparent from the fact that they are continuous and
uniform in inclination up to the solid rear wall of the choir.'</p>

<p>But in regard to the existence of an intentional widening
upwards in this building, it should be observed: First, that as the
eastern wall of the church, 'the rear wall of the choir,' is
Turkish, nothing can be legitimately inferred from the features of
that wall about the character of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Byzantine construction. Secondly, the set back above the middle string-course on the other
walls of the church is an ordinary arrangement in a Byzantine
church, and if this were all 'the widening' for which Professor
Goodyear contended there would be no room for difference of
opinion. The ledge formed by that set back may have served to
support scaffolding. In the next place, due weight must be given to
the distortion which would inevitably occur in Byzantine buildings.
They were fabrics of mortar with brick rather than of brick with
mortar, and consequently too elastic not to settle to a large
extent in the course of erection. Hence is it that no measurements
of a Byzantine structure, even on the ground floor, are accurate
within more than 5 cm., while above the ground they vary to a much
greater degree, rendering minute measurements quite valueless.
Lastly, as the marble panelling was fitted after the completion of
the body of the building, it had to be adapted to any divergence
that had previously occurred in the settling of the walls or the
spreading of the vaults. The marble panelling, it should also be
observed, is here cut to the diagonal at one angle, and not at the
other.</p>

<p>Apart from the set back of the masonry at the middle
string-course, this church, therefore, supplies no evidence for an
intentional widening of the structure from the ground upwards. Any
further widening than that at the middle string-course was
accidental, due to the nature of the materials employed, not to the
device of the builder, and was allowed by the architect because
unavoidable. Such irregularities are inherent in the Byzantine
methods of building.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF SS. PETER AND MARK, HOJA ATIK MUSTAPHA
JAMISSI</h4>

<p>The Byzantine church, now Hoja Atik Mustapha Jamissi, situated
in the Aivan Serai quarter, close to the Golden Horn, is commonly
regarded as the church of SS. Peter and Mark, because it stands
where the church dedicated to the chief of the apostles and his
companion stood, in the district of Blachernae (Aivan Serai) and
near the Golden Horn.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a>
Such indications are too vague for a positive opinion on the
subject, but perhaps the Patriarch Constantius, who is responsible
for the identification, may have relied upon some tradition in
favour of the view he has made current.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Tafferner, chaplain to the embassy from Leopold I. of Austria to
the Ottoman Court, speaking of the patriarchal church in his day
(the present patriarchal church of S. George in the Phanar
quarter), says, 'Aedes haec in patriarchatum erecta est, postquam
Sultan Mehemet basilicam Petri et Pauli exceptam Graecis in
moscheam defoedavit' (<i>Caesarea legatio</i>, p. 89, Vien. 1668).
Probably by the church of SS. Peter and Paul he means this church
of SS. Peter and Mark. If so, the traditional name of the building
is carried back to the seventeenth century. The church of SS. Peter
and Mark, it is true, never served as a patriarchal church. That
honour belonged to the church of S. Demetrius of Kanabos, which is
in the immediate vicinity, and has always remained a Christian
sanctuary. Tafferner seems to have confused the two churches owing
to their proximity to each other. Or his language may mean that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>patriarchal seat was removed from S.
Demetrius when SS. Peter and Paul was converted into a mosque,
because too near a building which had become a Moslem place of
worship.</p>
</div>

<p>The church of SS. Peter and Mark was founded, it is said, by two
patricians of Constantinople, named Galbius and Candidus, in 458,
early in the reign of Leo I. (457-474). But the present building
cannot be so old. It is a fair question to ask whether it may not
be the church of S. Anastasia referred to in a chrysoboullon of
John Palaeologus (1342), and mentioned by the Russian pilgrim who
visited Constantinople in the fifteenth century (1424-53).<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>The church of SS. Peter and Mark was erected as a shrine for the
supposed tunic of the Theotokos, a relic which played an important
part in the fortunes of Constantinople on several occasions, as
'the palladium of the city and the chaser away of all diseases and
warlike foes.' As often happened in the acquisition of relics, the
garment had been secured by a pious fraud&mdash;a fact which only
enhanced the merit of the purloiners, and gave to the achievement
the colour of a romantic adventure. In the course of their
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Galbius and Candidus discovered, in
the house of a devout Hebrew lady who entertained them, a small
room fitted up like a chapel, fragrant with incense, illuminated
with lamps, and crowded with worshippers. Being informed that the
room was consecrated by the presence of a chest containing the robe
of the mother of their Lord, the pious men begged leave to spend
the night in prayer beside the relic, and while thus engaged were
seized by an uncontrollable longing to gain possession of the
sacred garment. Accordingly they took careful measurements of the
chest before them, and at Jerusalem ordered an exact facsimile of
it to be made. Thus equipped they lodged again, on their homeward
journey, at the house of their Galilean hostess, and once more
obtained leave to worship in its chapel. Watching their opportunity
they exchanged the chests, and forthwith despatched the chest
containing the coveted treasure straight <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> to Constantinople.
They themselves tarried behind, as though loth to quit a spot still
hallowed by the sacred robe. Upon their return to the capital the
pious thieves erected a shrine for their prize on land which they
owned in the district of Blachernae, and dedicated the building to
SS. Peter and Mark instead of to the Theotokos, as would have been
more appropriate, in the hope that they would thus conceal the
precious relic from the public eye, and retain it for their special
benefit. But the secret leaked out. Whereupon the emperor obliged
the two patricians to surrender their treasure, and, after
renovating the neighbouring church of the Theotokos of Blachernae,
deposited the relic in that sanctuary as its proper home.</p>

<p>The site of that celebrated church lies at a short distance to
the west of Hoja Atik Mustapha Jamissi, and is marked by the Holy
Well which was attached to it. The well, in whose waters emperors
and empresses were wont to bathe, is now enclosed by a modern Greek
chapel, and is still the resort of the faithful.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The plan of the church presents the simplest form of the
domed-cross type without galleries. The dome, without drum, ribs,
or windows, is almost certainly a Turkish reconstruction, but the
dome arches and piers are original. The arms of the cross and the
small chambers at its angles are covered with barrel vaults, and
communicate with one another through lofty, narrow arches. In the
treatment of the northern and southern walls of the building
considerable architectural elaboration was displayed. At the floor
level is a triple arcade; higher up are three windows resting on
the string-course; and still higher a window divided into three
lights. The arches in the church are enormously stilted, a feature
due to the fact that the only string-course in the building, though
structurally corresponding to the vaulting spring, has been placed
at the height of what would properly be the column string-course.
The three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span> apses, much altered by repairs, project
boldly, all of them showing three sides on the exterior. The roof
and the cornice are Turkish, and the modern wooden narthex has
probably replaced a Byzantine narthex. On the opposite side of the
street lies a cruciform font that belonged to the baptistery of the
church.<br /><br /></p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.

</div>

<p>From a church of this type to the later four-columned plan is
but a step. The dome piers of SS. Peter and Mark are still <big><b>L</b></big>-shaped, and form the internal angles of the cross. As the arches
between such piers and the external walls increased in size, the
piers became smaller, until eventually they were reduced to the
typical four columns of the late churches.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF THE MYRELAION, BODROUM JAMISSI</h4>

<p>The identification of Bodroum Jamissi as the church attached to
the monastery styled the Myrelaion rests upon the tradition current
in the Greek community when Gyllius visited the city. According to
that traveller, the church on the hill rising to the north of the
eastern end of the gardens of Vlanga, the site of the ancient
harbour of Theodosius, was known as the Myrelaion&mdash;'Supra
locum hortorum Blanchae nuncupatorum, olim Portum Theodosianum
continentium, extremam partem ad ortum solis pertinentem, clivus a
Septentrione eminet, in quo est templum vulgo nominatum
Myreleos.'<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> This agrees, so far, with
the statement of the Anonymus<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
of the eleventh century, that the Myrelaion stood on the side of
the city looking towards the Sea of Marmora. There is no record of
the date when the monastery was founded. But the House must have
been in existence before the eighth century, for Constantine
Copronymus (740-775), the bitter iconoclast, displayed his contempt
for monks and all their ways by scattering the fraternity, and
changing the fragrant name of the establishment, Myrelaion, the
place of myrrh-oil, into the offensive designation, Psarelaion, the
place of fish-oil.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The monastery was
restored by the Emperor Romanus I. Lecapenus (919-945), who devoted
his residence in this district to that object.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> Hence the monastery was sometimes described as
'in the palace of the Myrelaion,'<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
&#7952;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;
&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&#8055;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Mu;&upsilon;&rho;&epsilon;&lambda;&alpha;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>and as 'the monastery of the Emperor
Romanus,'<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> &Mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&#8051;&omega;&sigmaf;
&#8172;&#969;&mu;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&#8166;. It was strictly
speaking a convent, and became noteworthy for the distinguished
rank of some of its inmates, and as the mausoleum in which the
founder and many members of his family were laid to rest. Here
Romanus II. sent his sister Agatha to take the veil, when he was
obliged to dismiss her from the court to soothe the jealousy of his
beautiful but wicked consort Theophano.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a>
Upon the abdication of Isaac Comnenus, his wife Aecatherina and her
daughter Maria retired to the Myrelaion, and there learned that a
crown may be a badge of slavery and the loss of it liberty.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Here were buried Theodora,<a name="FNanchor_316"
id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> the wife of Romanus Lecapenus, in 923, and,
eight years later, his beloved son Christopher,<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> for whom he mourned, says the historian of the
event, with a sorrow 'greater than the grievous mourning of the
Egyptians.' Here also Helena, the daughter of Romanus Lecapenus,
and wife of Constantine VII. Porphyrogenitus, was laid to rest, in
981, after an imposing funeral, in which the body was carried to
the grave on a bier of gold adorned with pearls and other precious
stones.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> To this monastery were
transferred, from the monastery of S. Mamas, near the Gate of the
Xylokerkou, the three sarcophagi, one of them a fine piece of work,
containing the ashes of the Emperor Maurice and his children. And
here also Romanus Lecapenus himself was interred in 948, his
remains being brought from the island of Prot&eacute;, where his
unfilial sons, Stephen and Constantine, had obliged him to spend
the last years of his life as a monk.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 196.</i></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The building is on the 'four column' plan. The dome, placed on a
circular drum, is supported on four piers, and divided into eight
concave compartments, with windows in the <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>alternate compartments.
The arms of the cross, the chambers at the angles, and the bema are
all covered with cross-groined vaults that spring, like those in
the chapel of the Pammakaristos (p. <a href="#Page_151">151</a>),
from the vaulting level. The apsidal chambers have dome vaults, a
niche on the east recessed in an arch to form the apse, and a niche
both on the north and the south rising above the vaulting
string-course. In the lowest division of the south wall stood
originally a triple arcade with a door between the columns. The
arcade has been built up, but the moulded jambs and cornices of the
door, and the arch above it, now contracted into a window, still
show on the exterior, while the columns appear within the church.
Above the column string-course is a range of three windows, the
central window being larger than its companions; higher up in the
gable is a single light. The interior of the church has been much
pulled about and cut away. The narthex is in three bays, separated
by strong transverse arches, and terminates at either end in a high
concave niche that shows on the outside. The central bay has a dome
vault; the other bays have cross-groined vaults. The church had no
gynecaeum, although Pulgher indicates one in his plan. A striking
feature of the exterior are the large semicircular buttresses that
show beyond the walls of the church&mdash;six on the south side,
one on either side of the entrance on the west, and two on the
east, supporting the apsidal chambers. In the last case, however,
where entire buttresses would have been at once too large and too
close together, the buttresses are only half semicircles. The apses
project with three sides. The northern side of the church and the
roof are modern, for the building suffered severely in 1784 from
fire.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> The church stands on a
platform, built over a small cistern, the roof of which is
supported by four columns crowned by beautiful capitals. Hence the
Turkish name of the mosque, Bodroum, signifying a subterranean
hollow. Gyllius<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> is mistaken in
associating this church with the <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>large underground cistern
situated lower down the slope of the hill close to the bath Kyzlar
Aghassi Hamam.</p>

<p>Gyllius (<i>De top. C.P.</i> iii. c. 8) places the Horreum, the
statue of Maimas, the house of Craterus, the Modius, and the arch
bearing the two bronze hands, after passing which a criminal on the
way to punishment lost all hope of reprieve, near this church;
basing that opinion on the statement of Suidas that these buildings
stood near the Myrelaion. But there was a Myrelaion also (Codinus,
<i>De aed.</i> p. 108) in the district in which the Shahzad&eacute;
mosque is situated. The buildings above mentioned were near this
second Myrelaion. On the other hand, the Chrysocamaron near the
Myrelaion mentioned by Codinus (<i>De signis</i>, pp. 65-66) stood
near the church under our consideration, for it was close to the
church of S. Acacius in the Heptascalon. So also, doubtless, did
the xenodocheion Myrelaion (Du Cange, iv. p. 160), possibly one of
the many philanthropic institutions supported by Helena (Theoph.

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. JOHN THE BAPTIST IN TRULLO, ACHMED PASHA
MESJEDI</h4>

<p>The identification of the church of S. John the Baptist in
Trullo (&Mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7937;&gamma;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&#8053;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&delta;&rho;&#8057;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;
&#7992;&omega;&#8049;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &#7952;&nu; &tau;&#8183;
&Tau;&rho;&omicron;&#8059;&lambda;&lambda;&#8179;) with the mosque
of Achmed Pasha Mesjedi is based on two reasons: first, because of
their common proximity to the church of the Pammakaristos,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> now Fetiyeh Jamissi; secondly, on the ground of
the tradition current in the Greek community on that point. The
latter reason is in this case particularly strong, seeing the
church of the Pammakaristos was the patriarchal cathedral almost
immediately after the Turkish conquest, and retained that honour
until 1591.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> The highest Greek
ecclesiastical authorities were therefore in a position to be
thoroughly acquainted with the dedication of a church in their
close vicinity. In 1578 the protonotarius of the patriarch showed
Gerlach the site of the Trullus close to Achmed Pasha Mesjedi.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>The church is mentioned in history only by Phrantzes,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> who informs us that when the Patriarch Gennadius
trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>ferred the patriarchal seat to the
monastery and church of the Pammakaristos, certain nuns previously
accommodated in that House were removed to the neighbouring
monastery of S. John Baptist in Trullo. Phrantzes explains the
designation of the church, 'in Trullo,' as derived from a palace
named Trullus which once stood in the vicinity to the north of the
Pammakaristos. It was the palace, adds the historian,<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> in which the Council of Constantinople, known as
the Concilium Quinisextum
(&Pi;&epsilon;&nu;&theta;&#8051;&kappa;&tau;&eta;), or the second
Concilium Trullanum, assembled in 692, in the reign of Justinian
II. But the palace Trullus, in which the first Concilium Trullanum
met in 680, was one of the group of buildings forming the Great
Palace<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> beside the Hippodrome, and
there the second Concilium Trullanum also held its meetings.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Phrantzes is therefore mistaken in
associating the Council of 692 with a palace in the vicinity of the
Pammakaristos and Achmed Pasha Mesjedi. But his mistake on that
particular point does not preclude the existence of a palace named
Trullus in the neighbourhood of the Pammakaristos. In fact, the
existence of such a palace in that district is the only possible
explanation of the attachment of the style 'in Trullo' to a church
on the site of Achmed Pasha Mesjedi. Nor is it strange to find a
name pertaining primarily to a building in the Great Palace
transferred to a similar building situated elsewhere. The imperial
residence at the Hebdomon, for example, was named Magnaura after

<a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> indeed, maintains that the building to which
Phrantzes refers was the palace at Bogdan Serai, the subsequent
residence of the Moldavian hospodar in Turkish days, and that the
church of S. John in Trullo was not Achmed Pasha Mesjedi, but the
church of S. John in Petra (Kesm&eacute; Kaya) beside that palace.
This opinion, however, is at variance with the statements of
Phrantzes and Gerlach. Furthermore, the designation 'in Petra' was
so distinctive a mark of the church of S. John near Kesm&eacute;
Kaya, that the church could scarcely have been recognised under
another style.</p>

<p>S. John in Trullo belongs to the ordinary 'four column' type of
church building, and has a narthex. Its three apses are
semicircular both within and without, presenting the only instance
in Constantinople of apses semicircular on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> exterior.
The central apse projects m. 3 beyond the body of the building, and
was lighted by a large but low window, divided into three lights by
two pilasters crowned with carved capitals (for details see Fig. <a href="#fig_68">68</a>); the diaconicon has been built up to
form the mihrab of the mosque; the prothesis, to the north, has a
barrel vault.<br />

<p>The drum dome is octagonal, with eight ribs and as many windows.
It seems large for the size of the church, and is lower than usual
inside. The windows do not cut into the exterior cornice of the
dome. Originally the dome arches rested on four piers or columns,
but these have been removed in the course of Turkish repairs, and
the dome arches are now supported by beams running across the
church, under the impost of the arches.</p>

<p>The arms of the cross to the north and south have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span> barrel
vaults, and the walls are pierced by triple windows. Two capitals
built into the exterior face of the northern wall, and marked with
a cross, were doubtless the capitals of the shafts which divided
the northern window into three lights. The western arm of the cross
is covered by the roof of the narthex, and lighted by a small
round-headed window above it. The small narthex is in three bays,
covered with cross-groined vaults.</p>

<p>It is not probable that the church was converted into a mosque
before 1591, when the patriarchal seat was removed from the
Pammakaristos to S. Demetrius beside the Xyloporta. Nor could the
conversion have been later than 1598, the year in which Achmed
Pasha&mdash;who converted the building into a mosque&mdash;died.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. THEKLA, TOKLOU IBRAHIM DED&Eacute;
MESJEDI</h4>

<p>In the quarter of Aivan Serai, a few paces to the rear of the
Heraclian Wall, stands a small mosque known as Toklou Ibrahim
Ded&eacute; Mesjedi, the architectural features of which proclaim
it at once to be an old Byzantine chapel. There is no decisive
tradition in regard to the identity of the building. The Patriarch
Constantius is uncertain whether it should be recognised as the
church of S. Nicholas or as the church of S. Thekla, two
sanctuaries situated in the quarter of Blachernae. It cannot have
been the former, inasmuch as the site of that church was near the
Holy Well, still venerated by Christians and Moslems,<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> in the area enclosed between the Wall of
Heraclius and the Wall of Leo the Armenian, now a picturesque
Turkish cemetery. One argument for regarding the building as the
church of S. Thekla, in this part of the city, is the striking
similarity of its Turkish name Toklou to the Greek name Thekla,
rendering it exceedingly probable that the former is a corruption
of the latter, and a reminiscence of the original designation of
the edifice.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> Turkish authorities,
however, have their own explanation of the name Toklou. In the
<i>Historical and Geographical Dictionary</i> of Achmed Rifaat
Effendi, we are told that a certain Toklou Ded&eacute; was the
guardian of the tombs of the companions of Khaled, who took part in
the first siege of Constantinople (673) by the Saracens. 'His real
name was Ghazi Ismail; Dogulu was his nickname. Now Dogh is the
Persian for a drink named <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>Airan (a mixture of curds and water),
and he was called Dogulu Ded&eacute; because during the siege his
business was to distribute that drink to the troops. At his request
a Christian church near Aivan Serai was converted into a mosque.
The church was formerly named after its founder, Isakias.'<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> Another Turkish explanation of Toklou derives
the epithet from the rare Turkish term for a yearling lamb, and
accounts for its bestowal upon Ibrahim Ded&eacute; as a pet name
given in gratitude for his services to the thirsty soldiers engaged
in the siege of the city.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>
In keeping with these stories is the tradition that the cemetery in
the area between the Walls of Heraclius and Leo V. the Armenian, is
the resting-place of Saracen warriors who fell in the siege of 673.
But have we not here the fancy-bred tales which Oriental
imagination weaves to veil its ignorance of real facts? When
etymology or history fails, romance is substituted. We may as well
believe the tradition that the body of Eyoub, the standard-bearer
of Mahomet, lies buried at the head of the Golden Horn, in the
mosque of Eyoub, where the Sultan girds the sword on his accession
to the throne. No Moslem graves could have been tolerated between
the lines of the city's fortification in Byzantine days. The
cemetery between the old walls near Toklou Ibrahim Ded&eacute;
Mesjedi must therefore be later than the Turkish conquest. And as
soon as Moslems were laid there, it was almost inevitable that a
church in the immediate neighbourhood should either be destroyed or
converted into a mosque. By what name that mosque would thenceforth
become known was, of course, an open question. The new name might
be purely Turkish. But when it sounds like the echo of a name which
we know belonged to a Byzantine building in this quarter of the
city before Turkish times, it is more reasonable to regard the new
name as a transformation of the earlier Greek term, than to derive
it from fine-spun etymological fancies and historical blunders. The
identification, therefore, of Toklou Ibrahim Ded&eacute; Mesjedi
with the church of S. Thekla, on the ground of the similarity of
the two names, has a strong presumption in its favour.</p>

<div class="center">NOTE ON THE CHURCH OF S. THEKLA</div>

<div class="center">(<span class="smcap">Chapter
XIII.</span>)</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>On page 209, note 3, I have said that if the mosque Aivas
Effendi (more correctly Ivaz Effendi), which is situated behind the
Tower of Isaac Angelus within the old area of the palace of
Blachernae, could be proved to stand on the site of a church, the
argument in favour of the identification of the Church of S. Thekla
with Toklou Ded&eacute; Mesjedi would be weakened. Since this book
went to the press, my learned friend Mr. X. A. Siderides has shown
me a passage in the historical work of Mustapha Effendi of
Salonica, published in 1865, where the mosque of Ivaz Effendi is
described as a church converted into a mosque by a certain Ivaz
Effendi who died in 1586, at the age of ninety. In that case we
should have a Christian sanctuary whose position corresponded
strictly with the position occupied by the Church of S. Thekla "in
the palace of Blachernae," an indication not exactly accurate in
regard to Toklou Ded&eacute; Mesjedi. In view of the late date of
Mustapha Effendi's work, and the absence, so far as I can judge, of
Byzantine features in the structure of the mosque, it is difficult
to decide if the arguments in favour of the identification of the
Church of S. Thekla with Toklou Ded&eacute; Mesjedi are entirely
overthrown by the statement of Mustapha Effendi.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>A second consideration in support of this identification is the
statement made by Achmed Rifaat Effendi, that before the church
became a mosque it was known by the name of its founder, 'Isakias.'
For it is a matter of history that the church of S. Thekla was
restored by the Emperor Isaac Comnenus<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
in the eleventh century. The association of his name with the
building was therefore perfectly natural, if the building is indeed
the old church of S. Thekla, otherwise it is difficult to account
for that association.</p>

<p>There is, however, one objection to this identification that
must not be overlooked. According to Byzantine authorities, the
church of S. Thekla stood in the palace of Blachernae
(&#7952;&nu;&tau;&#8056;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8182;&nu;
&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8055;&omega;&nu;;
&#7952;&nu; &tau;&#8183;
&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&#8055;&#8179; &tau;&#8182;&nu;
&Beta;&lambda;&alpha;&chi;&#8051;&rho;&nu;&omega;&nu;<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>). That palace occupied the heights above Aivan
Serai, on which the quarter of Egri Kapou and the mosque of Aivas
Effendi now stand, within the walls that enclose the western spur
of the Sixth Hill. Toklou Ibrahim Ded&eacute; Mesjedi, however,
does not stand within that enclosure, but immediately to the north
of it, on the level tract that stretches from the foot of the Sixth
Hill to the Golden Horn. If the reasons in favour of regarding the
mosque as S. Thekla were less strong, this objection would,
perhaps, be fatal. But the strip of land between the northern wall
of the palace enclosure and the sea is so narrow, and was so
closely connected with the life of the imperial residence, that a
building on that tract might with pardonable inaccuracy be
described, as 'in the palace.'<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>The church is mentioned for the first time in the earlier half
of the eighth century as a chapel
(&epsilon;&#8016;&kappa;&tau;&#8053;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;) which
Thekla, the eldest daughter of the Emperor Theophilus, restored and
attached to her residence at Blachernae.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>
The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>princess was an invalid, and doubtless
retired to this part of the city for the sake of its mild climate.
To dedicate the chapel to her patron saint was only natural. As
already intimated, the church was rebuilt from the foundations, in
the eleventh century, by Isaac Comnenus, in devout gratitude for
his escape from imminent death<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
in the course of his campaign against the barbarous tribes beside
the Danube, when he was overtaken at the foot of the Lovitz
mountain by a furious tempest of rain and snow. The plain on which
his army was encamped soon became a sheet of water, and many of his
men and animals were drowned or frozen to death. Thunder,
lightning, and hurricane combined to produce an awful scene, and
there were moments when the whole world seemed on fire. The emperor
took shelter under a large oak, but, fearing the tree might be
thrown down by the furious wind, he soon made for open ground.
Scarcely had he done so when the oak was torn up by the roots and
hurled to the earth. A few moments later the emperor would have
been killed. This narrow escape occurred on the 24th September, the
festival day of S. Thekla, and, therefore, attributing his
deliverance to her intervention, Isaac rebuilt and greatly
beautified the old sanctuary dedicated to her in Blachernae, and
frequently attended services there in her honour. Anna Comnena<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> speaks of the restored church in the
highest terms. According to her it was built at great cost,
displayed rare art, and was in every way worthy of the occasion
which led to its erection. Zonaras<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>
is not so complimentary. He describes the church as a monument of
the niggardliness of Isaac Comnenus. In any case, it was pulled
down and rebuilt in the following century by the Emperor John
Comnenus in splendid style, and dedicated to the Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> As the beauty and wealth of a Byzantine
sanctuary were exhibited in the lavish adornment of the interior,
it is possible that the church of S. Thekla, though small and
outwardly plain, may have been a beautiful and rich building in its
latest Christian character. It had then the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>honour of
seeing among the worshippers before its altar Anna Dalassena, the
mother of the Comneni. For, when charged with the government of the
Empire during the absence of Alexius Comnenus from the capital,
that able woman came often to pray in this church, 'lest she should
be immersed in merely secular affairs.'<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i><br />
 <small>(For Plan see p. <a href="#Page_206">206</a>)</small></div>

<p>The building is an oblong hall, m. 13.55 by m. 5.4, divided into
three compartments. It is now covered with a wooden roof, but the
arrangements of the breaks or pilasters on the walls indicate that
it had originally a dome. At the east end is a single apse, the
usual side-apses being represented by two niches. The western
compartment served as a narthex. During the repairs of the mosque
in 1890, frescoes of the eikons which once decorated the walls were
brought to view. On the exterior the apse shows three sides,
crowned with a corbelled cornice. The central side is pierced by a
window of good workmanship, divided by a shaft into two lights, and
above the window are two short blind concave niches. High blind
concave niches indent the other sides of the apse. In the northern
wall are the remains of a triple window, divided by shafts built in
courses. Above this is a row of three small windows.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. SAVIOUR PANTEPOPTES, ESKI IMARET MESJEDI</h4>

<p>The reasons which favour the identification of the mosque Eski
Imaret Mesjedi, which is situated on the heights above Aya Kapou
(Gate of S. Theodosia), with the church of S. Saviour Pantepoptes,
the All-Seeing
(&pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&pi;&#8057;&pi;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;),
are the following: first, the tradition to that effect,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> which in the case of a building so conspicuous
can scarcely be mistaken; secondly, the correspondence of its
position to that of the Pantepoptes, on a hill commanding an
extensive view of the Golden Horn;<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>
and finally, the architectural features which mark it to be what
the church of the Pantepoptes was, a building of the Comnenian
period. The church of the Pantepoptes was founded or restored by
Anna Dalassena,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> the mother of Alexius
I. Comnenus (1081-1118), one of the most remarkable women in
Byzantine history, combining to a rare degree domestic virtues with
great political ambition and administrative ability. For twenty
years she was associated with her son in the government of the
Empire, and was the power behind the throne which he owed largely
to her energy and devotion. About the year 1100 she laid aside the
cares of state, and without renouncing altogether her royal style
retired to rest in the monastery she had built, until her death,
five years later, at an advanced age.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a>
There is nothing of special importance <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>to record in the annals
of the House. Its inmates were occasionally disturbed by the
confinement among them of some dignitary who had offended the
Government, or by the theological disputes that agitated the
ecclesiastical circles of the capital.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>
But for the most part life at Pantepoptes was quiet and peaceful.
Only once does the monastery stand out conspicuous before the eyes
of the world. When the Venetian ships under Henrico Dandolo, with
the army of the Fourth Crusade on board, lined the shore of the
Golden Horn from Ispigas and the church of S. Saviour the
Benefactor to Blachernae (<i>i.e.</i> from Jubali Kapoussi to Aivan
Serai) on Easter Monday, 12th April 1204, the Emperor Alexius
Murtzuphlus established his headquarters beside the Pantepoptes.
There he pitched <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span> his vermilion tent, marshalled his best
troops, and watched the operations of the enemy. And thence he fled
when he saw the walls on the shore below him carried by storm, and
Flemish knights mounted on horses, which had been landed from the
hostile fleet, advancing to assault his position. So hurried was
his flight that he left his tent standing, and under its shelter
Count Baldwin of Flanders and Hainault slept away the fatigue of
that day's victory.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> During the Latin
occupation the church passed into the hands of the Venetians, and
was robbed of many of its relics for the benefit of churches in the
West.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> Upon the Turkish conquest
it served for some time as an imaret or refectory for the students
and teachers of the <i>medress&eacute;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> then in course of construction beside the great
mosque of Sultan Mehemed. Hence its Turkish name. After serving
that purpose it was converted into a mosque later in the reign of
the conqueror.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>In plan the church belongs to the 'four column' type, and has
two narthexes. The dome, placed on a drum, circular within and
twelve-sided without, is carried on four piers which the Turks have
reduced to an irregular octagonal form. It is divided into twelve
bays by square ribs, and is lighted by twelve semicircular-headed
windows. The cornice-string is adorned with a running leaf spray of
a pleasing and uncommon design. The arms of the cross have barrel
vaults, while the chambers at its angles are covered with
cross-groined vaults. The apsidal chambers are small, with shallow
niches on the north, south, and west, and a somewhat deeper niche
on the east where the apse stands. These niches are carried up
through a vaulting string-course, carved with a repeating leaf
ornament, and combine with the groined vault above them to produce
a charming canopy. The southern transept gable, though <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>much built
up, still displays the design which occurs so frequently in
Byzantine churches, namely, three windows in the lunette of the
arch (the central light rising higher than the sidelights), and
three stilted arches below the vaulting string-course, resting on
two columns and containing three windows which are carried down to
a breastwork of carved marble slabs between the columns. The floor
of the church is paved with square red bricks, except in the apses,
where marble is employed. The gynecaeum, above the inner narthex,
is divided into three bays separated by broad transverse arches.
The central bay, which is larger than its companions, is covered
with a dome vault, and looks into the body of the church through a
fine triple arcade in the lunette of the western arm of the cross.
The smaller bays are covered with cross-groined vaults. As
elsewhere, the vaulting-string in the gynecaeum is decorated with
carved work. The inner narthex, like the gynecaeum above it, is
divided into three bays covered with cross-groined vaults, and
communicates with the church, as usual, by three doors. Its walls
seem to have been formerly revetted with marble. In the northern
wall is a door, now closed, which gave access to a building beyond
that side of the church. The exonarthex is also divided in three
bays, separated by transverse arches, and communicates with the
inner narthex by three doors and with the outer world by a single
door situated in the central bay. That bay has a low dome without
windows, while the lateral bays have groined vaults. Turkish
repairs show in the pilasters and the pointed arches which support
the original transverse arches. The doors throughout the building
are framed in marble jambs and lintels, adorned in most cases with
a running ornament and crosses. In the case of the doors of the
exonarthex a red marble, <i>br&egrave;che rouge</i>, is employed,
as in the exonarthex of the Pantokrator, another erection of the
Comnenian period. On the exterior the building is much damaged, but
nevertheless preserves traces of considerable elaboration. The
walls are of brick, intermixed with courses of stone, and on the
three sides of the central apse there are remains of patterned
brickwork. On the buttresses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span> to the southern wall are
roundels with radiating voussoirs in stone and brick, and if one
may judge from the fact that the string-course does not fit the
face of the wall, parts of the exterior of the church were
incrusted with marble. The round-headed windows of the dome cut
into its cornice. Under the church is a cistern<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> which Bondelmontius deemed worthy of mention.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> Until some twenty years ago extensive
substructures were visible on the north-east of the church,
affording homes for poor Greek families.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>
They were probably the foundations of the lofty monastery buildings
whose windows commanded the magnificent view of the Golden Horn
that doubtless suggested the epithet Pantepoptes, under which the
Saviour was worshipped in this sanctuary.</p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 214.</i></p>

<p>S. Saviour Pantepoptes is the most carefully built of the later
churches of Constantinople. The little irregularities of setting
out so common in the other churches of the city are here almost
entirely absent. This accuracy of building, the carving of the
string-courses, and the remains of marble decoration both within
and on the exterior, prove exceptional care.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. SAVIOUR PANTOKRATOR,<br />
 ZE&Iuml;REK KILISSI JAMISSI</h4>

<p>According to the tradition current in the city when Gyllius<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> and Gerlach<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a>
explored the antiquities of Constantinople, the large Byzantine
church, now the mosque Ze&iuml;rek Kilissi Jamissi, overlooking the
Golden Horn from the heights above Oun Kapan, was the famous church
of S. Saviour Pantokrator. There is no reason for doubting the
accuracy of this identification. The church was so important, and
so closely associated with events which occurred late in the
history of the city, that its identity could not be forgotten by
the Greek ecclesiastical authorities soon after the Turkish
conquest. Moreover, all indications of the position of the church,
although too vague to determine its precise site, are in harmony
with the tradition on the subject. For, according to Russian
pilgrims to the shrines of Constantinople, the Pantokrator could be
reached most readily from the side of the city on the Golden
Horn,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> and stood in the vicinity
of the church of the Holy Apostles<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>&mdash;particulars that agree with the situation
of Ze&iuml;rek Kilissi Jamissi.</p>

<p>The church was founded by the Empress Irene,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> the consort of John II. Comnenus (1118-1143),
and daughter of Ladislas, King of Hungary. She came to
Constantinople <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a>
</span>shortly before 1105 as the Princess
Pyrisca, a beautiful girl, 'a plant covered with blossoms,
promising rich fruit,' to marry John Comnenus, then heir-apparent
to the crown of Alexius Comnenus, and adorned eight years of her
husband's reign by the simplicity of her tastes and her great
liberality to the poor. The monastic institutions of the city also
enjoyed her favour, and not long before her death in 1126 she
assumed the veil under the name of Xen&eacute;. The foundations of
the church were, probably, laid soon after her husband's accession
to the throne, and to the church she attached a monastery capable
of accommodating seven hundred monks;<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>
a xenodocheion, a home for aged men, and a hospital.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p>But the pious and charitable lady had undertaken more than she
could perform, and was obliged to turn to the emperor for sympathy
and assistance. Accordingly she took him, one day, to see the
edifice while in course of erection, and falling suddenly at his
feet, implored him with tears to complete her work. The beauty of
the building and the devotion of his wife appealed so strongly to
John Comnenus that he forthwith vowed to make the church and
monastery the finest in the city, and altogether worthy of the
Pantokrator to whom they were dedicated;<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>
and so well did he keep his promise, that the honour of being the
founder of the church has been bestowed on him by the historian
Nicetas Choniates.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<p>The imperial typicon or charter of the monastery,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> granted in 1136, made the monastery an
autonomous institution, independent of the patriarch or the prefect
of the city, and exempt from taxes of every description. At the
same time it was provided with vineyards and richly endowed.</p>

<p>According to Scarlatus Byzantius<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
and the Patriarch Constantius,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a>
a mosaic in the building portrayed the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>Emperor Manuel Comnenus
(1141-1180) in the act of presenting the model of the church to
Christ. If that was the case the church was completed by that
emperor. As will immediately appear, Manuel certainly enriched the
church with relics.</p>

alt="S. Saviour Pantokrator, from the west." title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">S. Saviour Pantokrator,
from the west.</span></p></div>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 220.</i></p>

<p>The history of the Pantokrator may be conveniently divided into
three periods: the period of the Comneni; the period of the Latin
Empire; and the period of the Palaeologi.</p>

<p>During the first the following incidents occurred: Here, as was
most fitting, the founders of the church and monastery were laid to
rest, the Empress Irene in 1126,<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>
the Emperor John Comnenus<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>
seventeen years later. Here their elder son Isaac was confined,
until the succession to the throne had been settled in favour of
his younger brother Manuel. That change in the natural order of
things had been decided upon by John Comnenus while he lay dying in
Cilicia from the effects of a wound inflicted by the fall of a
poisoned arrow out of his own quiver, when boar-hunting in the
forests of the Taurus Mountains, and was explained as due to
Manuel's special fitness to assume the care of the Empire, and not
merely to the fact that he was a father's favourite son. But when
the appointment was made Manuel was with his father in Cilicia,
while Isaac was in Constantinople, in a position to mount the
throne as soon as the tidings of John's death reached the
capital.</p>

<p>The prospect that Manuel would wear the crown seemed therefore
very remote. But Axuch, an intimate friend and counsellor of the
dying emperor, started for Constantinople the moment Manuel was
nominated, and travelled so fast, that he reached the city before
the news of the emperor's death and of Manuel's nomination was
known there. Then, wasting no time, Axuch made sure of the person
of Isaac, removed him from the palace, and put him in charge of the
monks of the Pantokrator, who had every reason to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>be loyal
to the wishes of the deceased sovereign. The wily courtier then set
himself to win the leading men in the capital over to the cause of
the younger brother, and, by the time Manuel was prepared to enter
Constantinople, had secured for him a popular welcome and the
surrender of Isaac's claims.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>In 1147, the famous eikon of S. Demetrius of Thessalonia was
transferred from the magnificent basilica dedicated to the saint in
that city to the Pantokrator. This was done by the order of Manuel
Comnenus, at the request of Joseph, then abbot of the monastery,
and in accordance with the wishes of the emperor's parents, the
founders of the House.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a>
It was a great sacrifice to demand of the Macedonian shrine, and by
way of compensation a larger and more artistic eikon of S.
Demetrius, in silver and gold, was hung beside his tomb. But
Constantinople rejoiced in the greater sanctity and virtue of the
earlier picture, and when tidings of its approach were received,
the whole fraternity of the Pantokrator, with the senate and an
immense crowd of devout persons, went seven miles out from the city
to hail the arrival of the image, and to bear it in triumph to its
new abode, with psalms and hymns, lighted tapers, fragrant incense,
and the gleam of soldiers' spears. Thus, it was believed, the
monastery gained more beauty and security, the dynasty of the
Comneni more strength, the Roman Empire and the Queen of cities an
invisible but mighty power to keep enemies afar off.</p>

<p>In 1158 Bertha, the first wife of Manuel Comnenus, and
sister-in-law of the Emperor Conrad of Germany, was buried in the
church.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> Twenty-two years later,
Manuel Comnenus himself was laid in its hero&ouml;n in a splendid
sarcophagus of black marble with a cover cut in seven

<a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> Beside the tomb was placed
the porphyry slab upon which the body of Christ was supposed to
have been laid after His deposition from the cross. The slab was
placed there in commemoration of the fact that when it was brought
from Ephesus to Constantinople, Manuel <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>carried it on his broad
shoulders all the way up the hill from the harbour of the Bucoleon
(at Tchatlady Kapou), to the private chapel of the imperial
residence near S. Sophia.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>
Nicetas Choniates thought the aspect of the tomb and of its
surroundings very significant. The seven protuberances on its cover
represented the seven-hilled city which had been the emperor's
throne; the porphyry slab recalled the mighty deeds which he whose
form lay so still and silent in the grave had wrought in the days
of his strength; while the black marble told the grief evoked by
his death. Robert of Clari, who saw the tomb in 1203, extols its
magnificence. 'Never,' says he, 'was born on this earth a holy man
or a holy woman who is buried in so rich and splendid a fashion as
this emperor in this abbey. There is found the marble table on
which Our Lord was laid when taken down from the cross, and there
are still seen the tears which Our Lady shed upon it.'<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>Some seven months after Manuel's death a strange spectacle was
witnessed at his tomb. His cousin, Andronicus Comnenus, the torment
of his life and one of the worst characters in Byzantine history,
taking advantage of the intrigues and disturbances which attended
the minority of Manuel's son and successor, Alexius II. Comnenus,
left his place of exile in Paphlagonia and appeared in
Constantinople at the head of an army, as though the champion of
the young sovereign's cause. No sooner had he reached the city than
he proceeded to visit Manuel's tomb, to show the regard he
professed to feel for a relative and sovereign. At the sight of the
dark sarcophagus Andronicus gave way to the most violent paroxysms
of grief. So deep and prolonged, indeed, did his distress seem,
that his attendants implored him to control his feelings and leave
the sad spot. But the mourner protested that he could not quit so
hastily a place hallowed by such sacred and tender associations.
Moreover, he had not yet said all he had to tell the dead. Bending,
therefore, again over the grave, Andronicus continued to address
the deceased. The words were inaudible, but they seemed a fresh
outpouring of sorrow, and deeply <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>affected many of the
spectators, for, as the mourner had not lived on the best terms
with his imperial cousin, his grief appeared to be the victory of a
man's better nature. But those who knew Andronicus well interpreted
his conduct as the performance of a consummate actor, and
understood his whispers to mean curses and vows of vengeance upon
his dead and helpless relative. Events justified this
interpretation. For Andronicus ere long usurped the throne,
murdered Alexius, insulted his remains, ordered his head to be cut
off, and cast the mutilated corpse into the Sea of Marmora to the
strains of music.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>During the Latin occupation the church was appropriated for
worship according to the ritual of the Roman Communion, and many of
its relics, its vessels of gold and silver, its jewels and
vestments, were carried off to enrich S. Mark's at Venice, and
other shrines of Western Christendom. How great a value was set
upon such trophies, and by what strange methods they were secured,
is seen in the account which Guntherus,<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a>
a contemporary historian, gives of the way in which some of the
relics of the church were acquired. As soon as the Crusaders
captured the city in 1204 and gave it over to pillage, a numerous
band of looters made for the Pantokrator in search of spoil, having
heard that many valuables had been deposited for safe keeping
within the strong walls around the monastery. Among the crowd
hastening thither was Martin, abbot of the Cistercian Abbey of
Parisis in Alsace, who accompanied the Crusade as chaplain and
chronicler. The fever of plunder raging about him was too
infectious for the good man to escape. When everybody else was
getting rich he could not consent to remain poor. His only scruple
was not to defile his holy hands with the filthy lucre which
worldlings coveted. To purloin sacred relics, however, was lawful
booty. Entering, therefore, the Pantokrator with his chaplain,
Martin accosted a venerable, white-bearded man who seemed familiar
with the building, and in stentorian tones demanded where the
relics of the church were to be found. The person addressed was, in
fact, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a>
</span>priest, though Martin had mistaken him for
a layman on account of the strangeness of the Greek clerical garb.
The priest did not understand Latin any more than the abbot
understood Greek, and the situation became awkward, for the pitch
of Martin's voice made it evident that he was not a person to be
trifled with. The old man therefore tried what the Romance patois,
which he had picked up from foreign residents in the city, could do
to establish intelligible intercourse with the rough visitor.
Fortunately the crusader also knew something of that patois, and
made the purpose of his visit sufficiently clear. As soon as the
iron safe containing the coveted relics was opened, abbot and
chaplain plunged four greedy hands into the hoard and stowed
relic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span> after relic under the ample folds of
their robes until there was no room for more. Thus laden, the pious
thieves made as fast as they could for the ship in which they had
come to Constantinople, not stopping to converse with friends on
the way, and giving to all curious inquiries the brief and
enigmatical reply, 'We have done well.' Upon reaching the ship
Martin found himself the happy possessor of no less than sixty-two
relics, including a piece of the Holy Cross, and drops of 'the
blood shed for man's redemption.' Martin wished to start
immediately for Alsace, but circumstances obliged him to remain in
Constantinople for several months. Thanks, however, to the priest
of the Pantokrator, whom the abbot had treated generously, Martin
secured a small chapel where to conceal his spoils until an
opportunity to return home should occur. A fellow-countryman,
indeed, the only other person let into the secret, advised him to
secure by means of the relics an abbotship, if not a bishopric, in
the Holy Land. But Martin was above personal ambition, and
notwithstanding all the difficulties involved in the attempt to
carry the relics to the West, waited patiently till he could
smuggle them out of the city. At length his chance came; whereupon
he embarked for Venice, and after a hard and tedious journey of
eight months reached home safely. Again and again on the way he had
narrowly escaped the loss of his treasures at the hands of pirates
on the sea and of brigands upon land. But all toils and dangers
were forgotten when, on the 24th of June 1205, at the head of the
brotherhood of which he was the chief, Martin placed the relics
purloined from the Pantokrator of Constantinople upon the high
altar of the church of Parisis with a conqueror's pride and joy,
while the people shouted, 'Blessed be the Lord God, the God of
Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.' There is archaeology even
in morals.</p>

<p>But while called thus to deplore the removal of many of its
valued relics, the Pantokrator came during the Latin period into
possession of a sacred object which compensated the house
abundantly for all losses of that kind. The church became the
shrine of the eikon of the Theotokos <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>Hodegetria. No relic was
held in higher estimation. It was considered to be the portrait of
the mother of our Lord painted by S. Luke, and was brought from
Jerusalem to Constantinople by the Empress Eudocia, wife of
Theodosius II., as a present to her sister-in-law Pulcheria. It led
the hosts of the Empire to victory, and shared the honours of their
triumphal entry into the capital. When enemies besieged the city,
the eikon was carried in procession through the streets and around
the fortifications, or was placed near the post of danger. After
the capture of the city by the Latins the picture was first taken
to S. Sophia, then the cathedral of the Venetian patriarchs of
Constantinople. But the Venetian clergy of the Pantokrator claimed
the sacred picture as their own, in virtue of a promise made to
them by the Emperor Henry; and when their claim was ignored, they
persuaded the podesta of the Venetian community to break into S.
Sophia and seize the eikon by force. In vain did the patriarch
appear upon the scene with candle and bell to excommunicate the
podesta, his council, and his agents for the sacrilegious act. The
coveted prize was borne off in triumph to the Pantokrator. In vain
did the Papal Legate in the city confirm the excommunication of the
guilty parties, and lay their churches under interdict. In vain
were those penalties confirmed by the Pope himself.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> The eikon kept its place in the Pantokrator
notwithstanding all anathemas until the fall of the Latin Empire,
when it was removed from the church to lead the procession which
came through the Golden Gate on the 15th August 1261, to celebrate
the recovery of Constantinople by the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a>

<p>Towards the close of the Latin occupation the monastery became
the residence of the Latin emperor, probably because the condition
of the public exchequer made it impossible to keep either the Great
Palace or the palace of Blachernae in proper repair. Money was not
plentiful in Constantinople <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>when Baldwin II., the last
Latin ruler of the city, was compelled to sell the lead on the roof
of his palace for a paltry sum, and to use the beams of his
outhouses for fuel, nor when he had to leave his son and heir in
the hands of the Capelli at Venice as security for a loan. Still,
the selection of the monastery for the emperor's abode, even under
these trying circumstances, implies the importance and comparative
splendour of the building. Here Baldwin was in residence when the
forces of Michael Palaeologus, under the command of Alexius
Strategopoulos, approached the city, and here he received the
intelligence, early in the morning of the 25th of July 1261, that
the Greeks had entered the city by the Gate of the Peg&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> (Selivri Kapoussi), and set fire to the
capital at four points. Baldwin's first impulse was to make a brave
stand. But his fleet and the greater part of his army were absent
from the city, engaged in the siege of Daphnusium on the coast of
the Black Sea. Meantime the fires kindled by the Greeks were
spreading and drawing nearer and nearer to the Pantokrator itself.
So casting off sword and helmet and every other mark of his
station, Baldwin took ship and led the flight of the Latin masters
of Constantinople back to their homes in the West.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>The first incident in the history of the Pantokrator after the
restoration of the Greek Empire was not fortunate. The monastery
then became the object upon which the Genoese, who had favoured
that event, and been rewarded with the grant of Galata as a trading
post, saw fit to vent the grudge they bore against certain
Venetians who, in the course of the feud between the two republics,
as competitors for the commerce of the East, had injured a church
and a tower belonging to the Genoese colony at Acre. To destroy
some building in Constantinople associated with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>Venice was
thought to be the best way to settle the outstanding account, and
so a band of Genoese made for the Pantokrator, over which the
banner of S. Mark had recently floated, and tore the monastery down
to the ground, making it a greater ruin than the Venetians had made
of the Genoese buildings in Syria. Then, not only to deprive the
enemy of his property but to turn it also to one's own advantage,
the scattered stones were collected and shipped to Genoa for the
construction of the church of S. George in that city.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a>

<p>In the reign of Michael Palaeologus, a member of the noble
family of the princes of the Peloponnesus became abbot of the
Pantokrator, and acquired great influence. He led, as we shall see,
the mission which conducted the emperor's daughter Maria to the
Mongolian court, and when the patriarchal seat was vacant in 1275,
a strong party favoured his appointment to that position instead of
Veccus.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>During the period of the Palaeologi the church frequently served
as a mausoleum for members of the imperial family. Here in 1317 was
buried Irene, the second wife of Andronicus II., a Spanish princess
and daughter of the Marquis of Monferrat. She came to
Constantinople in 1285, when only eleven years old, a beautiful
girl, Yolande by name, distinguished for the elegance of her
manners, and for a time was the idol of the court. But what with
the desire which she developed to amass wealth, and to see her sons
share in the government of the Empire, she ultimately proved the
cause of much unhappiness to her husband.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>
She deserves to be remembered for bequeathing the funds which
enabled Andronicus II. to build the buttresses supporting the walls
of S. Sophia on the north and east.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>
and not far off was the grave of Eugenia, the wife of the despot

overthrow John Cantacuzene and to recover the throne for the

<a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> As we follow to the grave
this procession of personages so closely associated with the fall

the imperial domains at Cassandra.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a>

<p>The most famous inmate of the Pantokrator was George Scholarius,
better known as Gennadius, the first patriarch of Constantinople
after the Turkish conquest. On account of his learning and legal
attainments he accompanied the Emperor John VII. Palaeologus and
the Patriarch Joseph to the Council of Ferrara and Florence in
1438, to take part in the negotiations for the union of
Christendom. As submission to the Papal demands was the only hope
of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a>
</span>obtaining the aid of the West for the
Roman Empire in the East, the emperor, with most of the Greek
clergy in attendance at the council, subscribed the decrees of that
assembly, and on the 8th July 1438 the two Churches were officially
reconciled and bound to common action. But it was a union without
sufficient religious motive on the one side and without strong
political interest on the other. Instead of improving the situation
it made matters worse. But drowning men clutch even unsubstantial
objects, and accordingly the Emperor Constantine Dragases, a few
years later, implored again the assistance of the Pope, begging him
to send a commission of Roman ecclesiastics to Constantinople to
confer once more with Greek theologians with the hope of making the
union more effective. In response to that request a Commission was
appointed, having at its head Cardinal Isidore, a Greek
ecclesiastic, who at the Council of Florence had cast in his lot
with the Latins and been created cardinal and titular archbishop of
Kiev. Isidore and his colleagues were welcomed with great
demonstrations of joy, and after several meetings with
representatives of the Eastern Church terms of union were once more
devised. The event was celebrated by a religious service in S.
Sophia, according to Roman rite, in the presence of the emperor,
the senate, and a large body of ecclesiastics. In the order of the
prayers offered that day in the cathedral of the East the name of
the Pope was mentioned first. But these proceedings only
exasperated the opponents of the union, who had the advantage in
numbers and in passionate convictions. Seeking for a leader they
flocked to the monastery of the Pantokrator to consult Gennadius.
It was a critical moment. Gennadius retired to his cell. Then
opening the door he affixed his answer in writing upon it, and
again shut himself in. The oracle had spoken: 'Wretched Romans,
whither have ye strayed, and gone far from hope in God to put your
trust in the Franks? Your city and your religion will perish
together. You abandon the faith of your fathers and embrace
impiety. Woe unto you in the day of judgment.' The words spread
like wild-fire and enflamed the excited crowd within and around
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span> monastery. Anathemas, cursing all
supporters of the union in the past, in the present, and in the
future resounded on every hand. The answer of Gennadius was carried
through the city and found an echo among all classes of the
population. Men ran to the taverns to drink undiluted wine, in
derision of the Roman practice of mixing water with the wine of the
Holy Communion; they shouted themselves hoarse with maledictions on
the unionists; they drank to the honour of the Theotokos, invoking
her aid as in the days of old, when she delivered the city out of
the hands of the Persians, the Avars, and the Saracens. Far and
wide rose the cry, 'Away with the help and the worship of the Latin
eaters of unleavened bread.'<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>
The two scenes witnessed, on the 12th December 1452, in S. Sophia
and at the Pantokrator displayed a discord that hastened the
downfall of New Rome. That day the party with the watchword,
'Better the turban of the Turk than the tiara of the Pope,' gained
the victory.</p>

<p>Upon the capture of the city, the Greek community, owing to the
recent death of the Patriarch Athanasius, found itself without an
ecclesiastical chief. The conqueror, anxious to conciliate his
Greek subjects, proclaimed complete religious toleration, and gave
orders that they should forthwith proceed to the free election of a
new patriarch. Under the circumstances there could be no question
as to the right man for the place. Gennadius, who had opposed the
unprofitable Latin alliance, and saved the national Church
notwithstanding the ruin of the Empire, was unanimously chosen to
be the first guide of his people along the strange and difficult
path they were now to follow. The choice being confirmed by the
Sultan, Gennadius left the Pantokrator to do homage to the new
master of the realm. Every mark of honour was paid to the prelate.
He was invited to the royal table and granted a long audience, at
which, following the practice of Byzantine emperors, the Sultan
presented him with a magnificent pastoral staff, and promised to
respect all the ancient privileges of the patriarchal see. When
Gennadius took leave, the Sultan <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>accompanied him to the foot
of the stairs of the palace, saw him mounted on a fine and richly
caparisoned horse, and ordered the notables of the court to escort
him to the church of the Holy Apostles, which was to replace S.
Sophia as the cathedral of the Greek Communion.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> It was certainly fortunate for the Orthodox
Church at that cruel moment in its history to find in one of the
cells of the Pantokrator a man able to win the goodwill of the
Empire's conqueror. When nothing could save the State, Gennadius
saved the nation's Church, and with the Church many forms of
national life. Muralt, looking at these transactions from another
standpoint, says, 'C'est ainsi que les Grecs virent accompli leur
v[oe]u d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;livr&eacute;s de l'union avec les
Latins.'<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>It would appear that the Pantokrator was abandoned by its
Christian owners very soon after the conquest. The great decrease
of the Greek population that followed the downfall of the city left
several quarters of Constantinople with few if any Christian
inhabitants, and so brought to an end the native religious service
in many churches of the capital. For some time thereafter the
deserted building was used by fullers and workers in leather as a
workshop and dwelling.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
But the edifice was too grand to be allowed to suffer permanent
degradation, and some twenty years later it was consecrated to
Moslem worship by a certain Ze&iuml;rek Mehemed Effendi.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> Its actual name, Ze&iuml;rek Kilissi Jamissi,
recalls the double service the building has rendered, and the
person who diverted it from its earlier to its later use.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>As it stands the Pantokrator is a combination of three churches,
placed side by side, and communicating with one another through
arched openings in their common walls. The three buildings are not
of the same date, and opinions differ in regard to their relative
age. On the whole, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234">234</a></span> the northern church may be safely
considered the earliest structure; the central church is somewhat
later; the southern church is the latest.<br />

<p><i>The Northern Church.</i>&mdash;This is a simple and dignified
building of the domed 'four column' type, with a gynaeceum above
the narthex. The narthex is in four <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span> bays covered with
cross-groined vaults on transverse arches. Its southern bay,
however, is a later extension, running about half-way in front of
the central church to give access to a door into that building.
Only two bays of the original narthex have doors opening into the
north church; the third door which once existed in the northern bay
has been partly built up. The narthex is very much out of repair,
and the western wall threatens to fall outwards. The dome, pierced
by eight windows, shows so many Turkish features that it may be
pronounced as mostly, if not wholly, a Turkish construction. The
four square piers which support it are manifestly Turkish. When
Gyllius visited the church in the sixteenth century the dome arches
rested on four columns of Theban granite, 'hemispherium sustentatur
quatuor arcubus, quos fulciunt quatuor columnae marmoris
Thebaici.'<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> Barrel vaults cover the
arms of the cross, which, as usual in churches of this type,
appears distinctly above the roof on the exterior. The southern arm
extends to the central church and its vault is pierced by two
windows, inserted, probably, to compensate for the loss of light
occasioned by the erection of that building. These windows furnish
one indication of the earlier date of the north church. The
gynaeceum, like the narthex below it, is covered with cross-groined
vaults and contains a small fireplace. The prothesis and diaconicon
have barrel vaults and apses with three sides projecting slightly
on the exterior. The main apse has a very lofty triple window, and
shows five sides. All the apses are decorated with high shallow
blind niches, a simple but effective ornament.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p><i>The Central Church.</i>&mdash;The central church is an oblong
hall covered by two domes, and terminates in a large apse. It is
extremely irregular in plan, and does not lie parallel to either of
the churches between which it stands. The domes are separated by a
transverse arch. The western dome, though flattened somewhat on the
four sides, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
approximately circular, and divided into sixteen shallow concave
compartments, each pierced by a window. Some of these windows must
have been always blocked by the roof of the north church. The
eastern dome is a pronounced oval, notwithstanding the attempt to
form a square base for it by building a subsidiary arch both on the
south and on the north. It is divided into twenty-four concave
compartments, twelve of which have windows. The drums of the domes
adjoin each other above the transverse arch, so that the central
west window of the eastern dome is pierced through to the western
dome. The two windows on either side of that window are blind, and
must always have been so. The floor in the archway leading into the
south church is paved with inlaid marbles forming a beautiful
design (Fig. <a href="#fig_76">76</a>). If the whole floor of the
church was thus decorated the effect must have been extremely rich.
On the exterior the apse shows seven sides, decorated with shallow
blind niches. Like the church it is very irregularly set out. (Plate <a href="#p_69">LXIX.</a>)</p>

<p>The central church probably served as a mausoleum for the tombs
of the imperial personages interred at the Pantokrator. In its form
and in the arrangement of its domes, as well as in its position on
the south of the church to which it strictly belongs, it resembles
the parecclesion of S. Saviour in the Chora (p. <a href="#Page_310">
310</a>).</p>

<p><i>The South Church.</i>&mdash;The south church is of the same
plan as the north church, but is larger and more richly decorated.
It has two narthexes, which extend to both the north and south
beyond the body of the building. The outer narthex, entered by a
single door placed in the centre, is in five bays, covered with
cross-groined vaults resting on pilasters. Its floor is paved with
large slabs of Proconnesian marble surrounded by a border of red
marble. Five doors lead to the esonarthex&mdash;the three central
doors being framed in red marble, the other two in verd antique. On
either side of the central door is a window also framed in verd
antique, the jambs of the windows being cut from old columns, and
retaining the circular form on their faces. Over the central door
and the windows beside it is a large <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span> arch between two smaller
arches&mdash;all three, as well as their bracket capitals, now
partially built up. There is a door framed in verd antique in each
end bay of the narthex. Like the outer narthex the esonarthex is in
five bays, and was paved with marble in a similar fashion. But
while its other bays are covered with cross-groined vaults the
central bay is open to the gallery above, and is overhung by a drum
dome. The gallery was thus divided into two parts by the open
central bay, and both gallery and narthex were lighted by the dome.
The exterior of this dome is twelve-sided, with flat angle
pilasters and level moulded plaster cornice. It has evidently been
repaired by the Turks. The inside, however, preserves the Byzantine
work. It is in twenty-four concave apartments pierced by twelve
windows, of which those facing the west cross arm of the church are
blind. As the original west window still shows from the inside,
though built up, it would appear that the gynecaeum dome was added
after the completion of the main church. At present the open bay is
ceiled by the woodwork that forms the floor of the tribune occupied
by the Sultan when he attends worship in the mosque.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> A door in the northern wall of the north bay
communicates with the narthex of the north church, while a door in
the eastern wall of the bay gives access to the central church. Two
doors in similar positions in the bay at the south end of the
narthex led to buildings which have disappeared. The three doors
leading from the narthex into the church are framed in red marble,
the other doors in white marble. The main dome of the church is in
sixteen compartments, and is pierced by as many windows. Its arches
rest on four shafted columns, somewhat Gothic in character, and
crowned with capitals distinctly Turkish. These columns have
replaced the columns of porphyry, seven feet in circumference,
which Gyllius saw bearing the arches of the dome when he visited
the church: 'maximum (tectum) sustentatur quatuor columnis
pyrrhopoecilis, quarum perimeter habet septem pedes.'<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> The southern wall is lighted by a triple window
in the gable and a row of three windows <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span> below the
string-course. The northern wall was treated on the same plan, but
with the modifications rendered necessary by the union of the
church with the earlier central church. The triple windows in the
gable of that wall are therefore almost blocked by the roof of the
central church against which it is built; while the three windows
below the string-course are blind and are cut short by the arch
opening into the central church, as that arch rises higher than the
string-course.</p>

<p>As explained, the gynaeceum above the inner narthex is divided
by the open central bay of that narthex into two compartments, each
consisting of two bays. The bays to the south are narrow, with
transverse arches of decidedly elliptical form. A window divided by
shafts in three lights, now built up, stood in the bay at the
extreme south, and similar windows looked down into the open bay of
the narthex from the bays on either hand. The northern compartment
of the gynaeceum connects with the gynaeceum of the north
church.</p>

<p>In the interior the apse retains a large portion of its
revetment of variously coloured marbles, and gives some idea of the
original splendour of the decoration. Fragments of fine carving
have been built into the pulpit of the mosque, and over it is a
Byzantine canopy supported on twin columns looped together, like
the twin columns on the fa&ccedil;ade of S. Mark's at Venice.</p>

<p>The lateral apses are covered with cross-groined vaults, and
project in three sides externally, while the central apse shows
seven sides. All are lighted by triple windows, and decorated on
the exterior with niches, like the other apses in this group of
buildings, and those of S. Theodosia.</p>

<p>In the brickwork found in the fabric of the Pantokrator, as Mr.
W. S. George has pointed out, two sizes of brick are employed, a
larger and a smaller size laid in alternate courses. The larger
bricks look like old material used again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>As already intimated, the monastery was
autonomous,

&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&epsilon;&xi;&omicron;&#8059;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;),
and its abbot was elected by the brotherhood in the following
manner:&mdash;On some suitable occasion the abbot for the time
being placed secretly in a box the names of three members of the
fraternity whom he considered fit to succeed him after his death,
and having sealed the box deposited it in the sacristy of the
church. Upon that abbot's death the box was opened in the presence
of the whole fraternity, and the names recommended by the late
chief were then put to the vote. If the votes were unanimous the
person thus chosen became the new abbot without further delay. But
in case of disagreement, a brother who could neither read nor write
placed the same names upon the altar of the church; there they
remained for three days; and then, after the celebration of a
solemn service, another illiterate monk drew one name off the
altar, and in doing so decided the question who should fill the
vacant office. The church was served by eighty priests and fifty
assistants, who were divided into two sets, officiating on
alternate weeks.</p>

<p>In connection with the monastery there was a bath, capable of
containing six persons, in which the monks were required to bathe
twice a month, except during Lent, when the bath was used only in
cases of illness.</p>

<p>The home for old men supported by the House accommodated
twenty-four persons, providing them with bread, wine, oil, cheese,
fuel, medical attendance, and small gifts of money.</p>

<p>The hospital had fifty beds for the poor. It was divided into
five wards: a ward of ten beds for surgical cases; another, of
eight beds, for grave cases; a third, of ten beds, for less serious
complaints; the fourth ward had twelve beds for women; the fifth
contained ten beds for what seemed light cases. Each ward was in
charge of two physicians, three medical assistants, and four
servitors. A lady physician, six lady medical assistants, and two
female nurses, took charge of the female patients. The sick were
visited daily by a house doctor, who inquired whether they were
satisfied with their treatment, examined their diet, and saw to the
cleanliness of the beds. The ordinary diet consisted of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span> bread,
beans, onions, oil, and wine.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>
Throughout their history the monasteries of Constantinople
remembered the poor. (See Plate <a href="#p_3">III.</a>)<br />

near the Pantokrator stood a church dedicated to the Theotokos

that contained the tombs of the Emperor John Comnenus and the
Empress Irene. But according to Cinnamus (pp. <a href="#Page_14">14,</a> <a href="#Page_31">31</a>), as we have seen (<a

Is it possible that of the three buildings commonly styled the
church of the Pantokrator, one of the lateral churches was
dedicated specially to the Theotokos Eleousa, and that the central
building which served as a mausoleum was dedicated to the archangel
Michael? The parecclesion of the Chora where Tornikes was buried
(p. <a href="#Page_310">310</a>) was associated, as the frescoes in

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. THEODORE, KILISSI MESJEDI</h4>

<p>High up the western slope of the Third Hill, in a quiet Turkish
quarter reached by a narrow street leading off Vefa Meidan, stands
a small but graceful Byzantine church, known since its use as a
mosque by the style Kilissi Mesjedi. Authorities differ in regard
to its dedication. Gyllius<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a>
was told that the church had been dedicated to S. Theodore. On the
other hand, Le Noir, on the strength of information furnished by
Greek friends, and after him Bayet, Fergusson, Salzenberg, claim it
as the church of the Theotokos of Lips. But the church of that
dedication was certainly elsewhere (p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>).
Mordtmann<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> suggests that we have
here the church of S. Anastasia Pharmacolytria
(&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&phi;&alpha;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&tau;&rho;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;),<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> and supports his view by the following
argument. In the first place the church of S. Theodore the Tiro was
situated in the quarter of Sphorakius,<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>
which was in the immediate vicinity of S. Sophia,<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> and therefore not near Vefa Meidan. Secondly,
the indications given by Antony of Novgorod and by the Anonymus of
the eleventh century respecting the position of S. Anastasia point
to the site of Kilissi Mesjedi. The fact that the church was ever
supposed to be dedicated to S. Theodore is, in Mordtmann's opinion,
a mistake occasioned by the circumstance that both S. Theodore and
S. Anastasia were credited with the power of exposing sorcery and
frauds, so that a church associated with one of these saints might
readily be transferred to the other, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>especially in the confusion
which followed the Turkish conquest.</p>

<p>In reply to this line of argument, it may be urged, first, that
the presence of a church of S. Theodore in the district of
Sphorakius does not prevent the existence of a church with a
similar dedication in another part of the city. S. Theodore was a
popular saint. There was a church named after him in the district
of Claudius (&tau;&#8048;
&Kappa;&lambda;&alpha;&upsilon;&delta;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;);<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> another church built in his honour stood
in the district Carbounaria (&tau;&#8048;
&Kappa;&alpha;&rho;&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;&#8049;&rho;&iota;&alpha;);<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> the private chapel of the emperors in the
Great Palace was dedicated to S. Theodore;<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> and according to Phrantzes,<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a>] a church dedicated at once to S. Theodore the
Tiro and S. Theodore the General, as at Athens, was erected in
Constantinople in his day. As to the indications supposed to favour
the view that the church of S. Anastasia stood at Kilissi Mesjedi,
they are, to say the least, exceedingly vague and inconclusive.
According to Antony of Novgorod<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
the shrine of S. Anastasia was found near the church of the
Pantokrator, on the Fourth Hill, whereas Kilissi Mesjedi stands on
the Third Hill. Furthermore, the order in which the Anonymus<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> refers to the church of S. Anastasia
Pharmacolytria, immediately before the Leomacellum, which Mordtmann
identifies with the Et Meidan, would allow us to place S. Anastasia
in the valley of the Lycus. Under these circumstances it is wiser
to accept the information given to Gyllius as correct; for while
the Greeks of his day were not infallible in their identification
of the buildings of the city, there is no evidence that they were
mistaken in this particular case.</p>

<a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a>
agrees so far with this view, but maintains, at the same time, that
the building was the church of S. Theodore 'in the district of
Sphorakius.' That identification is inadmissible, for beyond all
dispute the district of Sphorakius stood close to S. Sophia and not
at Vefa Meidan. M&uuml;hlmann<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>
likewise regards Kilissi Mesjedi as a church of S. Theodore, and
identifies it with the church dedicated to that saint in the
district of Carbounaria. This is possible, although the Anonymus<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> mentions the Carbounaria before the
Anemodoulion and the forum of Taurus (the region of the Turkish War
Office), and consequently suggests a position for the Carbounaria
much farther to the east than Vefa Meidan. Still the order in which
the Anonymus mentions places and monuments cannot be confidently
appealed to as coincident with their relative positions.<br /><br /></p>

<p>To which of the many saints named Theodore in the Greek Calendar
this church was actually dedicated is a point open to discussion,
but we cannot go far wrong in ascribing it to one of the two most
prominent saints of that name, or, as sometimes was the case, to
both of them, S. Theodore the Tiro and S. Theodore the General. The
former was a young soldier in the Roman army who was tortured and
put to death in 306 for not taking part in the persecution <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span> of
Christians under Maximian. The latter was a general in the army of
Licinius, and won the martyr's crown for refusing to sacrifice to
false gods, and for breaking their images in pieces. He was the
titular saint of the great church in Venice before that honour was
bestowed upon S. Mark the Evangelist. His relics were carried to
Venice from Constantinople in 1260, and his figure still stands on
one of the columns in the Piazzetta of S. Mark, with the attribute
of a dragon or a crocodile, symbolic of the false gods he
destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The church is a good example of the 'four column' type, with an
outer and an inner narthex. The former is in five bays, and extends
to the north and south, by one bay, beyond the inner narthex and
the body of the church. The terminal bays, it would seem, led to
cloisters built against the exterior of the northern and southern
sides of the building. Le Noir and Salzenberg<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> show a cloister along the south side of the
church, with four columns and an apse at its end. The central bay
and the two terminal bays are covered with domes on high drums,
without windows. The dome of the central bay has sixteen lobed
bays, while its companions have each eight flat ribs. All traces of
the mosaics which Salzenberg saw in the central dome have
disappeared. On the exterior the three domes are octagonal,
decorated with flat niches and angle shafts supporting an arched
cornice. The exonarthex deserves special attentions on account of
its fa&ccedil;ade. It is a fine composition of two triple arcades,
separated by a solid piece of masonry containing the door. On
either side of the door, and on the piers at each end of the
fa&ccedil;ade, are slender flat niches, similar to those which
occur in S. Mark's, Venice. The finely carved capitals of the
columns differ in type, the two northern being a variant of the
'melon type,' the pair to the south being Corinthian. They are
probably old <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span> capitals re-used. Throughout the building
are traces of stones from some older building recut or adapted to
the present church. Between the columns is a breastwork of carved
marble slabs similar in style to those seen in S. Mark's and in S.
Fosca, Torcello.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> The upper part of the
fa&ccedil;ade does not correspond to the composition below it, but
follows the divisions of the internal vaulting. It is in five
circular-arched bays, each containing an arched window. The
infilling is of brick in various patterns. The cornice looks
Turkish. While the masonry of the lower portion of the arcade is in
alternate courses of one stone and two bricks, that of the upper
portion has alternate courses of one stone and three bricks.
Moreover, while the design of the upper portion is determined by
the vaulting of the narthex, the lower portion takes a more
independent line. These differences may indicate different periods
of construction, but we find a similar type of design in other
Byzantine buildings, as, for example, in the walls of the palace of
the Porphyrogenitus, where the different stories are distinct in
design, and do not closely correspond to one another. The outer
narthex of S. Theodore may have been built entirely at one time, or
its upper story, vaults, and domes may have been added to an
already existing lower story. But in any case, notwithstanding all
possible adverse criticism, the total effect produced by the
fa&ccedil;ade is pleasing. It presents a noteworthy and successful
attempt to relieve the ordinary plainness and heaviness of a
Byzantine church exterior, and to give that exterior some grace and
beauty. The effect is the more impressive because the narthex is
raised considerably above the level of the ground and reached by a
flight of steps. 'Taking it altogether,' says Fergusson,<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> 'it is perhaps the most complete and elegant
church of its class now known to exist in or near the capital, and
many of its details are of great beauty and perfection.'</p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 246.</i></p>

<p>The esonarthex is in three bays covered with barrel vaults, and
terminates at both ends in a shallow niche. The outer arches spring
from square buttresses. From <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span> each bay a door conducts
into the church, the central door being set in a marble frame and
flanked by two Corinthian columns, which support a bold wall
arcade.</p>

<p>The drum of the dome is a polygon of twelve sides, and was
lighted by the same number of windows. It rests on four columns,
which were originally square, but now have large champs at the
angles, dying out at top and bottom. Barrel vaults cover the arms
of the cross, and dome vaults surmount the chambers at its angles.
As in the Pantokrator (p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>), the eastern
arm is pierced by two windows in the vaulting surface. The central
apse is lighted by a triple window, having oblong shafts, circular
on their inner and outer faces, and bearing capitals now badly
injured. A niche indents the northern, eastern, and southern
interior walls of the apsidal chapels. The windows in the northern
and southern walls of the church have been built up almost to their
full height, leaving only small openings for light at the top.
There can be little doubt that they were triple windows with a
parapet of carved marble slabs between the shafts. On the exterior
the apse shows five sides, and is decorated by an arcade of five
arches and an upper tier of five niches. The lateral apses do not
project beyond the face of the eastern wall, but are slightly
marked out by cutting back the sides and forming angular grooves.
Bayet<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> assigns the church to the
ninth or tenth century, the age of Leo the Wise and Constantine
Porphyrogenitus. Fergusson<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a>
is of the same opinion so far as the earlier portions of the
building are concerned. But that date is based on the mistaken view
that the building is the church of the Theotokos erected by
Constantine Lips. Diehl<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a>
assigns the church to the second half of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>In the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects, in
London, are four volumes of Texier's sketches and drawings of
buildings in or near Constantinople. In that collection is found a
complete set of drawings of this church, showing a chapel on both
the north and south sides of the building, and even giving
measurements on the south <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250">250</a></span> side. Texier's drawings are
unfortunately very inaccurate, so that little trust can be placed
in any of them. In addition to the plan of the church an elevation
is given, and two sketches covered with indications of elaborate
decoration, but evidently quite imaginary. The chapel on the north
side is noticed by no other writer, and was probably added by
Texier for the sake of symmetry. That on the south side, as shown
by him, differs in some respects from Salzenberg. The only thing
certain is that a side chapel did exist here.</p>

<p>This church presents a good example of the greater interest
taken during the later Byzantine period in the external appearance
of a church. To the exterior of the walls and the apses some
decoration is now applied. The dome is raised on a polygonal drum,
with shafts at its angles, and an arched cornice over its windows;
the roof gains more diversity of form and elevation by the
multiplication of domes, by the protrusion of the vaults of the
cross arms and of the apses, thus making the outward garb, so to
speak, of the building correspond more closely to the figure and
proportions of its inner body. In all this we have not yet reached
the animation and grace of a Gothic cathedral, nor the stateliness
that crowns an imperial mosque; but there is, at all events, a
decided advance towards a fuller expression of artistic feeling.

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<h4>THE MONASTERY OF MANUEL, KEFEL&Eacute; MESJEDI</h4>

<p>The mosque known as Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi, in the quarter of
Salma Tomruk, is commonly supposed to represent the monastery
founded by Manuel,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> a distinguished
general in the wars with the Saracens during the reign of
Theophilus (823-842). This opinion is doubtless based upon the
circumstance that the monastery in question stood in the vicinity
of the cistern of Aspar,<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a>
&sigma;&#8059;&nu;&epsilon;&gamma;&gamma;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&tau;&#8135; &kappa;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&rho;&nu;&#8131;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7948;&sigma;&pi;&alpha;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; (the large open
reservoir to the east of the Gate of Adrianople), near which
Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi is also situated. But that circumstance alone
cannot be regarded as sufficient ground for the identification of
the two buildings. There are at least five other monasteries
mentioned in Byzantine history, all distinguished by the mark of
their proximity to the cistern of Aspar.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>
And at a short distance to the west of Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi, and
nearer to the cistern of Aspar, we find the remains of an old
church, now Odalar Mesjedi, which might with equal force claim to
represent the monastery of Manuel. The commonly received
identification may, however, be correct as a happy conjecture. Mr.
Siderides,<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> indeed, considers the
identification of the monastery of Manuel with Kefel&eacute;
Mesjedi a mistake. According to him, that monastery was a
reconstruction or enlargement of the ancient monastery of SS.
Manuel, Sabel, and Ishmael, which stood on the heights above the
Phanar, now crowned by the mosque of Sultan Selim. To the objection
that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a>
</span> there it would not be near the cistern of
Aspar, Mr. Siderides replies by denying the correctness of the
identification of that cistern with the open reservoir (Tchoukour
Bostan) to the east of the gate of Adrianople, and in the vicinity
of Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi. In Mr. Siderides' opinion the cistern of
Aspar is the beautiful covered cistern, generally known as the
cistern of Puicheria, to the south-west of the mosque of Sultan
Selim.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> But the dimensions of the
cistern ascribed to the famous sister of Theodosius II. do not
accord with the size of the cistern of Aspar. The latter was 'a
very large cistern,' &tau;&#8052;&nu;
&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&#8055;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&nu;
&kappa;&iota;&nu;&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&rho;&nu;&alpha;&nu;,<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> while the former is only m. 29.1 long by m. 18
wide, with a roof supported on four rows of seven columns<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a>&mdash;not a large cistern as works of that class
went in Constantinople. But if the cistern of Aspar was not
situated in the district now marked by the mosque of Sultan Selim,
neither could the monastery of Manuel have been there. Mr.
Siderides,<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> moreover, identifies the
monastery of Manuel with that of Manoueliou (&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Mu;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&eta;&lambda;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;)
which appears in the Proceedings of the Synod held at
Constantinople in 536 under Justinian.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>
This, however, does not agree with the statement that the monastery
of Manuel was originally the private residence of the well-known
general of that name in the ninth century. Furthermore, it is
always dangerous to assume that the same name could not belong to
different buildings, especially when the name occurs at distant
intervals in the history of the city. Many mistakes in the
topography of Constantinople are due to this false method of
identification. As a matter of fact, the monastery of Manuel near
the cistern of Aspar was not the only House of that name in the
capital of the East. Another monastery of Manuel stood beside the
Golden Horn, in the Genoese quarter, between the gate of the
Neorion (Bagtch&eacute; Kapoussi) and the gate of Eugenius (Yali
Kiosk Kapoussi). It had a pier, known as the pier of the venerable
monastery of Manuel, &sigma;&kappa;&#8049;&lambda;&alpha;
&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&epsilon;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&mu;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8134;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
&Mu;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&#8053;&lambda;.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> Paspates is consequently wrong in associating
that pier with Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a>

<p>Mordtmann<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> accepts the identification
of Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi with the monastery of Manuel as correct,
but he identifies it also with the church and monastery which
Gerlach found in this neighbourhood, and describes under the name
of Aetius (&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7944;&epsilon;&tau;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;).<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> When visited by Gerlach in 1573, the church had
been converted into a mosque, and was a beautiful building in
excellent preservation. If all that remains of it is the bare
structure of Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi, the city has to mourn a great
loss.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> (Plate <a href="#p_77">LXXVII.</a>)</p>

<p>Manuel, the founder of the monastery, was the uncle of <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span> the
Empress Theodora, wife of the Emperor Theophilus, and proved a
loyal and devoted servant of the imperial family. Twice at the
peril of his own life he saved the emperor from capture, if not
from death, during the wars with the Saracens. Nevertheless, being
accused of treason he fled to the court of Baghdad and took service
under the Caliph Mutasim, until assured that Constantinople would
welcome him back.</p>

<p>He was one of the three counsellors appointed by Theophilus to
assist Theodora during the minority of Michael III., and so highly
was he esteemed, that he was acclaimed emperor by the populace in
the Hippodrome, and might have worn the crown but for his fidelity
to the little prince. Silencing the shouts raised in his favour, he
exclaimed, 'You have an emperor; my duty and highest honour is to
defend his infancy and to secure for him, even at the price of my
blood, the heritage of his father.' In the iconoclastic controversy
Manuel supported the policy of Theophilus, and therefore found
himself in a difficult position when Theodora decided to restore
the use of eikons. The story is, that while he lay dangerously ill
at the time, monks of the Studion assured him that recovery was
certain if he vowed to uphold the orthodox cause. The vow was
taken, and upon his restoration to health Manuel favoured the
measures of Theodora. Probably he felt that the current of public
feeling on the subject was too strong for him to oppose. But the
task of working in harmony with his colleagues in the regency,
Theoctistus and Bardas, was soon found impossible, and rumours of a
plot to blind him and remove him from the administration of affairs
led him to retire to his house near the cistern of Aspar. For some
time, indeed, he continued to appear occasionally at the palace,
but at last he quitted for ever that scene of intrigue, and
converted his residence into a monastery, where he might spend the
closing days of his life in peace and finally be laid in a quiet
grave.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi is a large oblong hall, m. 22.6 long by m.
7.22 wide, with walls constructed in alternate courses of four
bricks and four stones, and covered with a lofty timber roof. It
terminates to the north in an arch and a semicircular apse in
brick. Two niches, with a window between them, indent the walls of
the apse, and there is a niche in each pier of the arch. The
building is entered by a door situated in the middle of the western
wall. Originally the eastern and western walls, which form the long
sides of the building, were lighted by two ranges of round-headed
windows, somewhat irregularly spaced. The upper range is situated a
little below the ceiling, and forms a sort of clearstory of ten
lights; the lower range has five windows, except in the western
wall, where the place of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258"
id="Page_258">258</a></span> one window is occupied by the
entrance. The southern wall is also lighted by two ranges of
windows, the lower windows being much larger than the higher. At
some time buttresses were built against the eastern wall. Under the
west side is a cistern, the roof of which rests on three columns.
In view of all these features it is impossible to believe that the
building was a church. Its orientation, the absence of lateral
apses in a structure of such dimensions, the position of the
entrance, are all incompatible with that character. We have here,
undoubtedly, the refectory and not the sanctuary of the monastic
establishment. It resembles the refectory of the Laura on Mt.
Athos,<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> and that of Daphni near
Athens. It recalls the 'long and lofty building,' adorned with
pictures of saints, which formed the refectory of the Peribleptos
at Psamathia.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>There is a tradition that the use of the building was granted at
the conquest to the Armenian colony which was brought from Kaffa in
1475 to repeople the capital, Hence the Turkish name of the
building.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a>

heut zu Tage die Juden und Armenier weiss und blau durcheinander
tragen. Sein Weib hat einen Schleyer (<i>peplum</i>) fast wie die
Griechinnen. Der bedecte Gang und die Kirche sind ein Geb&auml;u
(<i>porticus muro etiam templi continetur</i>), und gehet man durch
zwey hohe Pforten hinein, welche 4 Theil in sich begreifft, oder in
4 Theil abgetheilet ist. 1. der bedeckte (<i>Porticus</i>) Gang,
dessen W&auml;nde mit Marmelstein biss auff die Helffte bekleidet
sind. Der Obertheil, da die Schwibb&ouml;gen (<i>Laquearia</i>)
anheben, hat er wie auch die Schwibb&ouml;gen selber die
Gem&auml;hlde. In diesem Gang oder Halle (<i>porticu</i>) stehen
die Weiber, und kommen nicht in die Kirchen hinein, wie auch in
andere Kirchen nicht, als wann sie zum Abendmahl gehen. 2. ist die
Kirche f&uuml;r sich so mit T&uuml;rckischen Deppichen
(<i>aoreis</i>) beleget und hat nur ein Thor. Ist ein hohes
Gew&ouml;lb (<i>laquearia</i>) und wie auch die &uuml;berige 2
Gew&ouml;lbe (<i>laquearia</i>) ganz verg&uuml;ldet und
&uuml;bermahlet, und die W&auml;nde von unten an biss an die
Schwibb&ouml;gen mit dem sch&ouml;nsten Marmelstein bekleidet. Auss
diesem gehet man 3. durch einen niedern Crepidinem in dem dritten
Theil der Kirchen, da der Bauherr oder Stiffter mit andern sehr
sch&ouml;nen Bildn&uuml;ssen mit Gold gemahlet stehen, mit einem
etwas niedern als der vorige Schwibb&ouml;gen (<i>laquearia</i>).
Auss diesem gehet man in den 4ten gew&ouml;lbten auch gemahlten

<p>'Not far from here is a very beautiful church where there is
said to have been in times past a very large monastery with many
houses for teachers and scholars within its walls. Nothing of all
that is to be seen now except the ruins of a splendid gate and a
dry cistern in which the Jews spin, throw, and prepare silk. In
front of the church there is a large court surrounded by a covered
passage (<i>porticus</i>), which is adorned with beautiful figures
from the Old and New Testaments painted on gilded quadrangular
glass cubes with Greek inscriptions; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span> the ancient faces of
these (figures) are scratched out. The walls of this passage are
covered with marble of different colours. It has also three or four
high crepidines<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> or vaulted
compartments (?) with the pictures of the prophets, of the
apostles, and of Christ in gold. The master of the house, or rather
the builder, or perhaps the founder, &#8001;
&kappa;&tau;&#8053;&tau;&omega;&rho;, and his wife are also painted
there in a costume very much the same as is worn to-day, but with a
very strange head-ornament, from which we may conclude that he was
one of the most distinguished of the imperial staff, for this
ornament looks almost like a duke's biretta of silk and fur; the
belt (<i>cinctura</i>) is of different colours, such as nowadays
the Jews or Armenians wear, white and blue mixed. His wife has a
veil (<i>peplum</i>) almost like that which Greek women have. The
covered passage and the church form one building (<i>porticus muro
etiam templi continetur</i>), entered by two high gates, and
comprising four parts, or divided into four parts. 1. The covered
passage (<i>porticus</i>), the walls of which as far as half their
height are covered with marble. On the upper part, where the arches
begin, and on the arches themselves are the paintings. In this
passage or hall stand the women, and do not enter the church as
they do not enter other churches, unless they go to the Lord's
supper. 2. Is the church, as such, covered with Turkish rugs, and
has only one gate. It has a high dome, which, like the remaining
two domes, is entirely gilded and painted, and the walls up to the
arches are covered with the most beautiful marble. From this one
enters 3. through a low vaulted compartment, with a somewhat lower
arch than the foresaid arches, the third part of the church, where
the founder with other very beautiful portraits (pictures) is
painted in gold. From this one enters 4. a vaulted and also
painted, but rather dark place, with many small windows. On the
outside of the walls of the church there is this inscription<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a>

<a href="#FNanchor_442"><span class="label">442</span></a> The question
thus raised presents serious difficulties. That some building<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">*</a> in the neighbourhood of Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi was
known by the name of Aetius<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">&#9840;</a>
is undoubted. It was a cistern (Du Cange, i. p. 96), and formed one
of the landmarks by which the church of S. John in Petra, situated
in this quarter of the city, was distinguished (Du Cange, iv. p.
152 &#7956;&gamma;&gamma;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&#7944;&epsilon;&tau;&#8055;&omicron;&upsilon;). But while that is
the case, Gyllius (<i>De top. C.P.</i> iv.), who explored this part
of the city in 1550, does not mention any Byzantine church that
answers at all to Gerlach's description of the church of Aetius,
unless it be the Chora. That Gyllius should have overlooked so
beautiful a monument of Byzantine days as the church of Aetius, if
different from the Chora, is certainly very strange. But it is not
less strange to find that Gerlach does not speak of the Chora. Can
the difficulty thus presented be removed by the supposition that
Gerlach refers to the Chora under the name of Aetius? The position
he assigns to the church of Aetius in relation to the church of S.
John in Petra and to the palace of Constantine (Tekfour Serai)
favours that view, for he places the church of Aetius between S.
John and the palace, exactly where the Chora would stand in that
series of buildings. Looking towards the north-west from the
windows of a house a little to the east of the Pammakaristos,
Gerlach says 'Ad Occasum, Boream versus, Prodromi
&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052; est, olim &pi;&#8051;&tau;&rho;&alpha;;
longius inde, Aetii &mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052;; postea, Palatium
Constantini' (<i>Turcograecia</i>, p. 190). On the other hand,
Gerlach's description of the church of Aetius differs in so many
particulars from what holds true of the Chora, that it is
difficult, if not impossible, to believe that in that description
he had the latter church in mind. Unless, then, we are prepared to
admit grave mistakes in Gerlach's description, we must either
assume an extraordinary failure on his part and on the part of
Gyllius to notice a most interesting Byzantine monument, directly
on the path of both explorers in this quarter of the city, or
regret the disappearance of an ancient sanctuary that rivalled the
Chora in splendour.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<a href="#FNanchor_A"><span class="label">*</span></a> It was probably the
ruined cistern with twenty-four columns arranged in four rows of
seven pillars each, near the mosque Kassim Aga, a short distance
above Kefel&eacute; Mesjedi. Gerlach associates it with the church
of Aetius.</p>

distinguish Manuel the general from Manuel the uncle of Theodora,
on the ground that the former is said to have died of wounds
received in battle during the reign of Theophilus (see Leo Gramm.
p. 222). But it would be strange for different Manuels to reside
near the cistern of Aspar, and to convert their residences into the
monastery of Manuel in that vicinity. For other reasons for the
identification see Bury, <i>Eastern Roman Empire</i>, Appendix

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h4>MONASTIR MESJEDI</h4>

<p>At a short distance within Top Kapoussi (Gate of S. Romanus)
that pierces the landward walls of the city, and a little to the
south of the street leading to that entrance, in the quarter of
Tash Mektep, Mustapha Tchaoush, stands a lonely Byzantine chapel
which now goes by the name Monastir Mesjedi, the Chapel of the
Monastery. Its present designation tells us all that is certain in
regard to the history of the edifice; it was originally a chapel
attached to a Christian monastery, and after the Turkish conquest
became a Moslem place of worshp. Paspates<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a>
is disposed to identify the building with the chapel of the
Theotokos erected in this vicinity, in the thirteenth or fourteenth
century, by Phocas Maroules<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a>
on the site of the ancient church dedicated to the three martyr
sisters Menodora, Metrodora, and Nymphodora.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> The chapel built by Maroules in fact belonged to
a convent, and owing to its comparatively recent date might well be
standing to this day. But the evidence in favour of the proposed
identification is slight. In a city crowded with sanctuaries more
than one small chapel could be situated near the gate of S.
Romanus. An old font, turned upside down and made to serve as a
well-head by having its bottom knocked out, lies on a vacant lot on
the same side of the street as Monastir Mesjedi, but nearer the
gate of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a>
</span> S. Romanus, and seems to mark the site of
another sanctuary. So likewise do the four columns crowned with
ancient capitals which form the porch of the mosque Kurkju Jamissi,
on the north side of the street.</p>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 262.</i></p>

<p>Phocas Maroules was domestic of the imperial table under
Andronicus II. Palaeologus (1282-1328). He appears also as the
commander of the guards on the city walls that screened the palace
of Blachernae, when Andronicus III. Palaeologus, accompanied by
John Cantacuzene, the protostrator Synadenus, and an escort of
thirty soldiers, stood before the gate of Gyrolimn&eacute; to
parley with the elder emperor. The domestic was the bearer of the
messages exchanged between the imperial relatives on that occasion.
It was a thankless task. But what troubled the mind of Maroules
most was how to avoid giving offence to both sovereigns and succeed
in serving two masters. To salute the grandson as became his rank
and pretensions would incur the grandfather's displeasure; to treat
rudely the young prince, who had come on a friendly errand, and
addressed the domestic in gracious terms, was an impropriety which
the reputation of Maroules as a paragon of politeness would not
allow him to commit. Furthermore, fortune being fickle, he felt
bound as a prudent man to consult her caprices. Accordingly,
allowing less discreet officials beside him to insult the younger
emperor as much as they pleased, he himself refrained both from all
taunts and from all courteous speech. In response to the greetings
of Andronicus III. he said nothing, but at the same time made a
respectful bow, thus maintaining his good manners and yet guarding
his interests whatever turn the dispute between the two emperors
might take. John Cantacuzene, a kindred spirit, extols the
behaviour of Maroules in this dilemma as beyond all praise.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p>After the death of Maroules his widow and son attempted to turn
the convent into a monastery. But the patriarchal court, before
which the case came in 1341, decided in favour of the claims of the
nuns, on the principle that the intention of the founder should in
such matters be always <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span> respected. Hence convents were not
allowed to be changed into monasteries, nor monasteries into
convents.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i><br />
 <small>(For Plan see p. <a href="#Page_261">261.</a>)</small></div>

<p>The building is a small oblong hall roofed in wood, and
terminates at its eastern end in three semicircular apses. It is
divided into two unequal compartments by a triple arcade placed
near the western end. The side apses are shallow recesses, scarcely
separated from the central apse, and show three sides on the
exterior. The central apse projects six sides, and is now lighted
by a large Turkish window. The western compartment, forming the
narthex, is in three bays covered with cross-groined vaults. The
cushion capitals on the columns of the arcade are decorated, on the
east and west, with a rudely cut leaf; and on the north and south
with a cross in a circle. Along the exterior of the south wall are
traces of a string-course, of a cloister, and of a door leading to
the western compartment. On the same wall Paspates<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> saw, as late as 1877, eikons painted in fresco.
The western entrance stands between two pilasters, and near it is
an upright shaft, buried for the most part in the ground, probably
the vestige of a narthex. In the drawing of the church given by
Paspates,<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> three additional shafts
are shown beside the building.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h4>BALABAN AGA MESJEDI</h4>

<p>A small Byzantine building, now used for Moslem worship under
the name of Balaban Aga Mesjedi, is situated in the quarter of
Shahzad&eacute;, off the south side of the street leading to the
mosque of Sultan Mehemed and the gate Edirne Kapoussi. Mordtmann<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> proposes to identify it with the church of
the Theotokos in the district of the Curator (&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&#8049;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;),
the foundation of which is ascribed to Verina, the consort of Leo
Macellus (457-474).<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> The only reason for
this conjecture is that the church in question stood where Balaban
Aga Mesjedi stands, in the neighbourhood of the forum of Taurus,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> now represented by the open area beside
the War Office and the mosque of Sultan Bajazet. But the plan of
the building does not correspond to the description given of the
Theotokos in the district of the Curator. The latter resembled the
Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem,<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>
and was therefore circular, whereas Balaban Aga Mesjedi is a
hexagon. Indeed, it may be questioned whether the building was ever
a church, seeing it has no room for either a berm, or an apse, or
an eikonostosis. It may have been the library of a monastic
establishment.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i><br />
 <small>(For Plans see p. <a href="#Page_267">267.</a>)</small></div>

<p>Internally the building is an accurate hexagon, with a deeply
arched recess in each side. Five recesses have a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span> window,
while in the sixth recess, instead of a window, there is a door.
The cornice and wooden ceiling are Turkish. Externally the edifice
shows four sides, two circular and two flat projecting bays,
arranged in alternate order. In each of the circular sides are two
windows, while the fifth window and the entrance are respectively
in the flat sides. A Turkish narthex fronts one-half of the
building. (Plate <a href="#p_55">LV.</a>)<br />

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF THE GASTRIA, SANJAKDAR MESJEDI</h4>

<p>This mosque is situated in the quarter of Psamathia, at a short
distance to the north of the Armenian church of S. George (Soulou
Monastir), which stands on the site of the Byzantine church of S.
Mary Peribleptos. Paspates,<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>
who first recognized the Byzantine character of the edifice,
regards it as the chapel attached to the convent of the Gastria
(&Mu;&omicron;&nu;&#8052; &tau;&#8182;&nu;
&Gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&#8055;&omega;&nu;, &tau;&#8048;
&Gamma;&#8049;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&iota;&alpha;, <i>i.e.</i> in the
district of the Flower-pots). His reasons for that opinion are:
first, the building is situated in the district of Psamathia, where
the convent of the Gastria stood; secondly, it is in the
neighbourhood of the Studion, with which the convent of the Gastria
was closely associated during the iconoclastic controversy;
thirdly, the copious and perennial stream of water that flows
through the grounds below the mosque would favour the existence of
a flower-garden in this part of the city, and thus give occasion
for the bestowal of the name Gastria upon the locality. The
argument is by no means conclusive. A more fanciful explanation of
the name of the district is given by Byzantine etymologists after
their wont. According to them the name was due to the circumstance
that the Empress Helena, upon her return from Jerusalem with her
great discovery of the Holy Cross, disembarked at Psamathia, and
having founded a convent there, adorned its garden with the pots
(&tau;&#8048; &gamma;&#8049;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&iota;&alpha;) of
fragrant shrubs which accompanied the sacred tree on the voyage
from Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> More sober historians
ascribe the foundation of the convent to <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>Euphrosyne, the
step-mother of the Emperor Theophilus,<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>
or to his mother-in-law Theoctista.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a>
Both ladies, it is certain, were interested in the House, the
former taking the veil there,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a>
while the latter resided in the immediate neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> Probably the convent was indebted to both those
pious women for benefactions, and it was unquestionably in their
day that the monastery acquired its greatest fame as the centre of
female influence in support of the cause of eikons. Theoctista was
especially active in that cause, and through her connection with
the court not only strengthened the opposition to the policy of her
son-in-law, but also disturbed the domestic peace of the imperial
family. Whenever the daughters of Theophilus visited her she took
the opportunity to condemn their father's views, and would press
her eikons on the girls' lips for adoration. One day, after such a
visit, Pulcheria, the youngest princess, a mere child, in giving an
account of what had transpired, innocently told her father that she
had seen and kissed some very beautiful dolls at her grandmother's
house. Whereupon Theophilus, suspecting the real facts, forbade his
daughter to visit Theoctista again. On another occasion the court
fool, Denderis, surprised the Empress Theodora in her private
chamber kissing eikons and placing them over her eyes. 'What are
these things?' he inquired. 'My beautiful dolls which I love,' she
replied. Not long afterwards the jester was summoned to amuse
Theophilus while sitting at table. 'What is the latest news?' asked
the emperor. 'When I last visited "mamma" (the jester's familiar
name for the empress) I saw most beautiful dolls in her room.'
Instantly the emperor rose, beside himself with rage, and rushing
to his wife's apartments violently denounced her as a heathen and
idolater. 'Not at all,' answered Theodora, in her softest accents,
'that fool of yours saw me and my maidens looking into a mirror and
mistook the faces reflected there for dolls.' The emperor did not
press the case, but a few days later the servants of Theodora
caught Denderis and gave him a sound thrashing for telling tales,
dismissing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a>
</span> him with the advice to let dolls alone in
the future. In consequence of this experience, whenever the jester
was afterwards asked whether he had seen his 'mamma's' dolls
recently, he put one hand to his mouth and the other far down his
back and whispered, 'Don't speak to me about dolls.'<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> Such were the pleasantries that relieved the
stern warfare against eikons.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the breach between Theodora and her son
Michael III., on account of the murder of her friend and counsellor
Theoctistos at Michael's order, she and her four daughters, Thekla,
Anastasia, Anna, and Pulcheria, were confined in the Gastria, and
there, with the exception of Anna, they were eventually buried.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> At the Gastria were shown also the tombs
of Theoctista, her son Petronas, Irene the daughter of Bardas, and
a small chest containing the lower jaw of Bardas<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> himself. It is this connection with the family
of Theophilus, in life and in death, that lends chief interest to
the Gastria.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i><br />
 <small>(For Plan see p. <a href="#Page_267">267.</a>)</small></div>

<p>Although the building is now almost a complete ruin, it still
preserves some architectural interest. On the exterior it is an
octagonal structure, with a large arch on each side rising to the
cornice, and thus presents a strong likeness to the Byzantine
building known as Sheik Suleiman Mesjedi, near the Pantokrator (<a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>). The northern, southern, and western
arches are pierced by windows. The entrance is in the western arch.
The interior presents the form of an equal-armed cross, the arms
being deep recesses covered with semicircular vaults. The dome over
the central area has fallen in. The apse, semicircular <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span> within
and showing five sides on the exterior, is attached to the eastern
arm. Its three central sides are occupied by a triple-shafted
window. Two shallow niches represent the usual apsidal chambers. A
similar niche is found also on both sides of the entrance and on
the eastern side of the northern arm of the cross. In the wall to
the west of the southern arch is a small chamber. The joint between
the apse and the body of the building is straight, with no bond in
the masonry; nor is the masonry of the two parts of the same
character. In the former it is in alternate courses of brick and
stone, while in the latter we find many brick courses and only an
occasional stone band. Evidently the apse is a later addition. In
view of these facts, the probable conclusion is that the building
was originally not a church but a library, and that it was
transformed into a church at some subsequent period in its history
to meet some special demand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARY OF THE MONGOLS</h4>

<p>The church of S. Mary of the Mongols (&tau;&#8182;&nu;
&Mu;&omicron;&gamma;&gamma;&omicron;&lambda;&#8055;&omega;&nu;,
&tau;&#8182;&nu;
&Mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&#8055;&omega;&nu;,
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&Mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&chi;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&#8166;,
&Mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&chi;&lambda;&iota;&#8061;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;),
which stands on the heights above the quarter of Phanar, a short
distance to the west of the Greek Communal School, was founded in
the thirteenth century by Maria Palaeologina, a natural daughter of
the Emperor Michael Palaeologus (1261-1282). As the church has been
in Greek hands ever since its foundation its identity cannot be
disputed. The epithet given to the Theotokos in association with
this sanctuary alludes to the fact that Maria Palaeologina married
a Khan of the Mongols,<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
and bore the title of Despoina of the Mongols
(&Delta;&#8051;&sigma;&pi;&omicron;&iota;&nu;&alpha;
&tau;&#8182;&nu;
&Mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&#8055;&omega;&nu;).<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> The marriage was prompted by no romantic
sentiment, but formed part of the policy by which her father hoped
to secure the goodwill of the world for the newly restored Empire
of Constantinople. While endeavouring to disarm the hostility of
Western Europe by promoting the union of the Latin and Greek
Churches, he sought to conciliate the people nearer his dominion by
matrimonial alliances with their rulers. It was in this way that he
courted, with greater or less success, the friendship of Servia,
Bulgaria, the Duchy of Thebes, and the Empire of Trebizond. And by
the same method he tried to win the friendship of the formidable
Mongols settled in Russia and Persia. Accordingly he bestowed the
hand of one natural daughter, Euphrosyne, upon Nogaya,<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> who had established a Mongolian principality
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span> near the Black Sea, while the hand of
Maria was intended for Holagu, famous in history as the destroyer
in 1258 of the caliphate of Baghdad. Maria left Constantinople for
her future home in 1265 with a great retinue, conducted by
Theodosius de Villehardouin, abbot of the monastery of the
Pantokrator, who was styled the 'Prince,' because related to the
princes of Achaia and the Peloponnesus. A rich trousseau
accompanied the bride-elect, and a tent of silk for a chapel,
furnished with eikons of gold affixed to crosses, and with costly
vessels for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice. When the mission
reached Caesarea news came that Holagu was dead, but since reasons
of state inspired the proposed marriage, the bridal party
continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a>
</span> its journey to the Mongolian court, and
there in due time Maria was wedded to Abaga, the son and successor
of Holagu, after the bridegroom had received, it is said, Christian
baptism.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></p>

<p>In 1281 Abaga was poisoned by his brother Achmed,<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> and Maria deemed it prudent, and doubtless
welcome, after an absence of sixteen years, to return to
Constantinople. She appears again in history during the reign of
her brother <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span> Andronicus II. Palaeologus, when for the
second time she was offered as a bride to the Mongolian prince,
Charbanda, who then ruled in Persia,<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a>
the object of this new matrimonial alliance being to obtain the aid
of the Mongols against the Turks, who under Othman had become a
dangerous foe and were threatening Nicaea. With this purpose in
view Maria proceeded to that city, both to encourage the defence of
an important strategic position and to press forward the
negotiations with Charbanda. The Despoina of the Mongols, however,
did not comprehend the character of the enemy with whom she had to
deal. Her contemptuous demeanour towards Othman, and her threats to
bring the Mongols against him, only roused the spirit of the
Turkish chieftain, and before the Greeks could derive any advantage
from the 30,000 Mongolian troops sent to their aid, Othman stormed
the fortress of Tricocca, an outpost of Nicaea, and made it the
base of his subsequent operations.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></p>

<p>The church was built for the use of a convent which the Despoina
of the Mongols, like many other ladies in Byzantine times, erected
as a haven of refuge for souls who had dedicated their lives to the
service of God (&lambda;&iota;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&alpha;
&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#8182;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048;
&theta;&epsilon;&#8056;&nu;
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&theta;&epsilon;&mu;&#8051;&nu;&omega;&nu;
&beta;&iota;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;). She also endowed it with
property in the immediate neighbourhood (&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&tau;&#8052;&nu;
&tau;&omicron;&pi;&omicron;&theta;&epsilon;&sigma;&#8055;&alpha;&nu;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &Phi;&alpha;&nu;&#8049;&rho;&iota;), as well
as with other lands both within and beyond the city, and while
Maria lived the nuns had no reason for complaint. But after her
death the property of the House passed into the hands of Isaac
Palaeologus Asanes, the husband of a certain Theodora, whom Maria
had treated as a daughter, and to whom she bequeathed a share in
the convent's revenues. He, as soon as Theodora died, appropriated
the property for the benefit of his family, with the result that
the sisterhood fell into debt and was threatened with extinction.
In their distress the nuns appealed to Andronicus III. Palaeologus
for protection, and by the decision of the patriarchal court, to
which the case was referred as the proper tribunal in such
disputes, the convent in 1351 regained its rights.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a>

</div>

<p>As already intimated, to this church belongs the interest of
having always preserved its original character as a sanctuary of
the Greek Orthodox Communion. This distinction it owes to the fact
that the church was given to Christoboulos, the Greek architect of
the mosque of Sultan Mehemed, as his private property, to mark the
conqueror's satisfaction with the builder's work. The grant was
confirmed by Bajazet II. in recognition of the services of the
nephew of Christoboulos in the construction of the mosque which
bears that Sultan's name. Twice, indeed, attempts were subsequently
made to deprive the Greek community of the church, once under Selim
I. and again under Achmed III. But, like the law of the Medes and
Persians, a Sultan's decree altereth not, and by presenting the
hatti sheriff of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span> Sultan Mehemed the efforts to expropriate
the building were frustrated.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></p>

<p>Among the Turks the building is known as Kan Kilisse, the church
of Blood, and the adjoining street goes by the name Sanjakdar
Youkousou, the ascent of the standard-bearer,<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> terms which refer to the desperate struggle
between Greeks and Turks at this point on the morning of the
capture of the city.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>Although the building has always been in Christian hands it has
suffered alterations almost more drastic than any undergone by
churches converted into mosques. The interior has been stripped of
its original decoration, and is so blocked by eikons, chandeliers,
and other ornaments as to render a proper examination of the church
extremely difficult. In plan the church is a domed quatrefoil
building, the only example of that type found in Constantinople.
The central dome rests on a cross formed by four semi-domes, which
are further enlarged below the vaulting level by three large
semicircular niches. It is placed on a drum of eight concave
compartments pierced by windows to the outside circular and crowned
with a flat cornice. Externally the semi-domes and apse are
five-sided. From the interior face of the apse and on its northern
wall projects a capital, adorned with acanthus leaves, which, as it
could never have stood free in this position, probably formed part
of an eikonostasis in stone. The narthex is in three bays, the
central bay being covered by a barrel vault, while the lateral bays
have low drumless domes on pendentives. The entrance is by a door
in the central bay, and from that bay the church is entered through
a passage cut in the central niche of the western semi-dome, and
slightly wider than the niche. The end bays open, respectively,
into the northern and southern semi-domes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span> by passages or aisles
terminating in a diagonal arch. The arches between these aisles and
the western semi-dome are pierced, and thus isolate the western
dome piers. On the south the church has been greatly altered; for
the entire southern semi-dome and the southern bay of the narthex
have been removed and replaced by three aisles of two bays each.
These bays are equal in height, and are covered by cross-groined
vaults with strong transverse pointed arches supported on square
piers, the whole forming a large hall held up by two piers, and
showing the distinct influence of Italian Gothic work. This part of
the building is modern. On the eastern wall is a large picture of
the Last Judgment.</p>

<p>The plan of this church may be compared with that of S. Nicholas
Methana (Fig. <a href="#fig_97">97</a>).<br />

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<h4>BOGDAN SERAI</h4>

<p>In a vacant lot of ground on the eastern declivity of the hill
above the quarter of Balat, and at a short distance to the east of
a mass of rock known as Kesm&eacute; Kaya, stands a Byzantine
chapel to which the name Bogdan Serai clings. Although now degraded
to the uses of a cow-house it retains considerable interest. Its
name recalls the fact that the building once formed the private
chapel attached to the residence of the envoys of the hospodars of
Moldavia (in Turkish Bogdan) at the Sublime Porte; just as the
style Vlach Serai given to the church of the Virgin, lower down the
hill and nearer the Golden Horn, is derived from the residence of
the envoys of the Wallachian hospodars with which that church was
connected. According to Hypselantes,<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>
the Moldavian residence was erected early in the sixteenth century
by Teutal Longophetes, the envoy who presented the submission of
his country to Suleiman the Magnificent at Buda in 1516, when the
Sultan was on his way to the siege of Vienna. Upon the return of
Suleiman to Constantinople the hospodar of the principality came in
person to the capital to pay tribute, and to be invested in his
office with the insignia of two horse-tails, a fur coat, and the
head-dress of a commander in the corps of janissaries. Gerlach<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> gives another account of the matter.
According to his informants, the mansion belonged originally to a
certain Raoul, who had emigrated to Russia in 1518, and after his
death was purchased by Michael Cantacuzene as a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span> home for
the Moldavian envoys. It must have been an attractive house,
surrounded by large grounds, and enjoying a superb view of the city
and the Golden Horn. It was burnt<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a>
in the fire which devastated the district on the 25th June 1784,
and since that catastrophe its grounds have been converted into
market gardens or left waste, and its chapel has been a desecrated
pile. But its proud name still haunts the site, calling to mind
political relations which have long ceased to exist. The chapel
stood at the north-western end of the residence and formed an
integral part of the structure. For high up in the exterior side of
the south-eastern wall are the mortises which held the beams
supporting the floor of the upper story of the residence; while
lower down in the same wall is a doorway which communicated with
the residence on that level. Some of the substructures of the
residence are still visible. It is not impossible that the house,
or at least some portion of it, was an old Byzantine mansion.
Mordtmann,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> indeed, suggests that it
was the palace to which Phrantzes refers under the name Trullus
(&#7952;&nu; &tau;&#8183;
&Tau;&rho;&omicron;&#8059;&lambda;&#8179;).<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> But that palace stood to the north of the church
of the Pammakaristos (Fetiyeh Jamissi), and had disappeared when
Phrantzes wrote. Gerlach,<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a>
moreover, following the opinion of his Greek friends, distinguishes
between the Trullus and the Moldavian residence, and places the
site of the former near the Byzantine chapel now converted into
Achmed Pasha Mesjedi, to the south of the church of the
Pammakaristos.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a>

<p class="quotsig"><i>To face page 280.</i></p>

<p>Opinions differ in regard to the dedication of the chapel.
Paspates,<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> following the view current
among the gardeners who cultivated the market-gardens in the
neighbourhood, maintained that the chapel was dedicated to S.
Nicholas. Hence the late Canon Curtis, of the Crimean Memorial
Church in Constantinople, believed that this was the church of SS.
Nicholas and Augustine of Canterbury, founded by a Saxon noble who
fled to Constantinople after the Norman <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span> conquest of England.
What is certain is that in the seventeenth century the chapel was
dedicated to the Theotokos. Du Cange mentions it under the name,
Ecclesia Deiparae Serai Bogdaniae.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></p>

<p>Mordtmann has proved<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a>
that Bogdan Serai marks the site of the celebrated monastery and
church of S. John the Baptist in Petra,&mdash;the title 'in Petra'
being derived from the neighbouring mass of rock, which the
Byzantines knew as &Pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&#8048;
&Pi;&#8051;&tau;&rho;&alpha;, and which the Turks style
Kesm&eacute; Kaya, the Chopped Rock.</p>

<p>According to a member of the monastery, who flourished in the
eleventh century, the House was founded by a monk named Bara in the
reign of Anastasius I. (491-518) near an old half-ruined chapel
dedicated to S. John the Baptist, in what was then a lonely quarter
of the city, between the Gate of S. Romanus (Top Kapoussi) and
Blachernae. The monastery becomes conspicuous in the narratives of
the Russian pilgrims to the shrines of the city, under the
designation, the monastery of S. John, Rich-in-God, because the
institution was unendowed and dependent upon the freewill offerings
of the faithful, which 'by the grace of God and the care and
prayers of John' were generous. Thrice a year, on the festivals of
the Baptist and at Easter, the public was admitted to the monastery
and hospitably entertained. It seems to have suffered during the
Latin occupation, for it is described in the reign of Andronicus
II. as standing abandoned in a vineyard. But it was restored, and
attracted visitors by the beauty of its mosaics and the sanctity of
its relics.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a></p>

<p>In 1381 a patriarchal decision conferred upon the abbot the
titles of archimandrite and protosyngellos, and gave him the third
place in the order of precedence among the chiefs of the
monasteries of the city, 'that thus the outward honours of the
house might reflect the virtue and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span> piety which adorned its
inner life.'<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> Owing to the proximity of
the house to the landward walls, it was one of the first shrines<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> to become the spoil of the Turks on the
29th of May 1453, and was soon used as a quarry to furnish
materials for new buildings after the conquest. Gyllius visited the
ruins, and mistaking the fabric for the church of S. John the
Baptist at the Hebdomon, gave rise to the serious error of placing
that suburb in this part of the city instead of at Makrikeui beside
the Sea of Marmora.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> Gerlach<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> describes the church as closed because near a
mosque. Portions, however, of the monastic buildings and of the
strong wall around them still survived, and eikons of celebrated
saints still decorated the porch. On an eikon of Christ the title
of the monastery, Petra, was inscribed. Some of the old cells were
then occupied by nuns, who were maintained by the charitable gifts
of wealthy members of the Greek community.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>The building is in two stories, and may be described as a chapel
over a crypt. It points north-east, a peculiar orientation probably
due to the adaptation of the chapel to the position of the
residence with which it was associated. The masonry is very fine
and regular, built in courses of squared stone alternating with
four courses of brick, all laid in thick mortar joints, and pierced
with numerous putlog holes running through the walls. It presents a
striking likeness to the masonry in the fortifications of the city.
The lower story is an oblong hall covered with a barrel vault, and
terminates in an arch and apse. In the west side of one of the
jambs of the arch is a small niche. The vault for one-third of its
height is formed by three courses of stone laid horizontally and
cut to the circle; above this it is of brick with radiating joints.
Here cows are kept.</p>

<p>The upper story is m. 3.75 above the present level <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>of the
ground. It is a single hall m. 8.80 in length and m. 3.70 wide,
terminating in a bema and a circular apse in brick. Over the bema
is a barrel vault. A dome, without drum or windows, resting on two
shallow flat arches in the lateral walls and two deep transverse
arches strengthened by a second order of arches, covers the
building. In the wall towards the north-west there is a window
between two low niches; and a similar arrangement is seen in the
opposite wall, except that the door which communicated with the
residence occupies the place of the window. The apsidal chambers,
usual in a church, are here represented by two niches in the bema.
Externally the apse shows five sides, and is decorated by a flat
niche pierced by a single light in the central side, and a blind
concave niche, with head of patterned brickwork, in the two
adjacent sides. The dome, apse, vaults, and transverse arches are
in brick, laid in true radiating courses. The absence of windows in
the dome is an unusual feature, which occurs also in the angle
domes of S. Theodosia. The pendentives are in horizontal courses,
corbelled out to the centre, and at each angle of the pendentives
is embedded an earthenware jar, either for the sake of lightness,
or to improve, as some think, the acoustics of the building. This
story of the chapel is used as a hayloft.</p>

<p>A careful survey of the building shows clearly that the domical
character of the chapel is not original, and that the structure
when first erected was a simple hall covered with a wooden roof.
Both the shallow wall arches and the deep transverse arches under
the dome are insertions in the walls of an older fabric. They are
not supported on pilasters, as is the practice elsewhere, but rest
on corbels, and, in order to accommodate these corbels, the lateral
niches, originally of the same height as the central window, have
been reduced in height. A fragment of the original arch still
remains, cut into by the wall arch of the dome. The flat secondary
arches crossing the chapel at each end are similarly supported on
corbels.</p>

<p>This view is confirmed by the examination of the plaster left
upon the walls. That plaster has four distinct coats or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span> layers,
upon all of which eikons in tempera are painted.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> The innermost coat is laid between the
transverse dome arches and the walls against which they are built.
Those arches, therefore, could not have formed parts of the
building when the first coat of plaster was laid, but must be later
additions.</p>

<p>In keeping with this fact, the second coat of painted plaster is
found laid both on the arches and on those portions of the old work
which the arches did not cover.</p>

<p>The secondary arches under the transverse arches at each end
belong to a yet later period, for where they have separated from
the arches above them, decorated plaster, which at one time formed
part of the general ornamentation of the building, is exposed to
view. At this stage in the history of the chapel the third coat of
plaster was spread over the walls, thus giving three coats on the
oldest parts where unaltered&mdash;two coats on the first
alterations, and one coat on the second alterations. The fourth
coat of plaster is still later, marking some less serious repair of
the chapel.</p>

<p>The <i>voussoirs</i> of the lateral dome arches should be
noticed. They do not radiate to the centre, but are laid flatter
and radiate to a point above the centre. This form of construction,
occurring frequently in Byzantine arches, is regarded by some
authorities as a method of forming an arch without centering. But
in the case of the lateral wall arches before us it occurs where
centering could never have been required; while the apse arch,
where centering would have had structural value, is formed with
true radiating <i>voussoirs</i>. The failure of the
<i>voussoirs</i> to radiate to the centre therefore seems to be
simply the result of using untapered <i>voussoirs</i> in which the
arch form must be obtained by wedge-shaped joints. For if these
joints are carelessly formed, the crown may very well be reached
before the requisite amount of radiation has been obtained. On the
other hand, if full centering had been used, we should expect to
find marks of the centering boards on the mortar <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span> in the
enormously thick joints. But neither here nor in any instance where
the jointing was visible have such marks been found. Still, when we
consider the large amount of mortar employed in Byzantine work, it
seems impossible that greater distortions than we actually meet
with in Byzantine edifices would not have occurred, even during the
building, had no support whatever been given. It seems, therefore,
safe to assume the use of at any rate light scaffolding and
centering to all Byzantine arches. <a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. SAVIOUR IN THE CHORA,<br />
 KAHRI&Eacute; JAMISSI</h4>

<p>According to the historian Nicephorus Gregoras,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> who was long and closely connected with the
church, the Chora was founded by Justinian the Great, and then
presented the form of a basilica. But there is reason to believe
that the edifice erected by that emperor was the reconstruction of
an older shrine. The fame of a restorer often eclipsed the memory
of the founder of a sanctuary, especially when the restorer was the
superior in rank and reared a larger and more beautiful
building.</p>

<p>According to Symeon Metaphrastes,<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a>
the site of the Chora was first consecrated by the interment of S.
Babylas and his eighty-four disciples, who were martyred in 298
during the reign of Maximianus. The scene of their execution,
indeed, was Nicomedia; but friendly hands obtained possession of
the bodies of the champions of the faith, and taking them to
Constantinople, buried them outside the walls of the city, towards
the north, in the place subsequently occupied by the monastery of
the Chora. As will appear, the relics of S. Babylas and his
disciples formed part of the treasures of the Chora in the ninth
century.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>The settlement of the approximate date of
the foundation of the church depends, ultimately, upon the meaning
to be attached to the term Chora (&Chi;&#8061;&rho;&alpha;). There
are some writers who incline to the idea that in this connection
that term was employed from the first in a mystical sense, to
denote the attribute of Christ as the sphere of man's highest life;
and there can be no doubt that the word was used in that sense in
the fourteenth century. That is unquestionably its meaning in the
legends inscribed on mosaics which adorn the walls of the
building.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img class="noborder"
src="images/mono3.png" width="350" height="71" alt="mono3." title="" /></div>

<p>And it is in that sense that the term is employed by
Cantacuzene<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> and Phrantzes.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> On this view the description of the church as
'in the Chora' throws no light on the date of the church's
foundation. Other authorities,<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a>
however, maintain that the term Chora was originally associated
with the church in the obvious topographical signification of the
word, to denote territory outside the city limits, and that its
religious reference came into vogue only when changes in the
boundaries of Constantinople made the literal meaning of Chora no
longer applicable. According to this opinion the church was,
therefore, founded while its site lay beyond the city walls, and
consequently before the year 413, after which the site was included
within the capital by the erection of the Theodosian wall.</p>

<p>Hence, the phrase 'in the Chora' had the same signification as
the style 'in the fields' which is attached to the church of S.
Martin in London, or the style <i>fuore le mura</i> which belongs
to the basilica of S. Paul and other churches beyond the walls of
Rome to this day.</p>

<p>It is certainly in this topographical sense that the term Chora
is understood by the Byzantine writers in whose works it first
appears. That is how the term is used by Simeon Metaphrastes<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> in his description of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span> the site
of the monastery in his day, and that is how the Anonymus<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> of the eleventh century and his follower
Codinus<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> understand the term; for
they take special care to explain how a building which lay within
the city in their day could be styled 'Chora'; because, say they,
it once stood without the walls, on territory, therefore, called by
the Byzantines, &chi;&omega;&rho;&#8055;&omicron;&nu;, the country.
The literal meaning of a word is earlier than its artificial and
poetical signification. And one can easily conceive how, when the
style Chora was no longer literally correct, men abandoned the
sober ground of common-sense and history to invent recondite
meanings inspired by imagination and sentiment.</p>

<p>This conclusion is confirmed by the history of the Chora given
in the Life of S. Theodore,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a>
an abbot of the monastery, which Mr. Gedeon discovered in the
library of the Pantokrator on Mount Athos. According to that
biography, S. Theodore was a relative of Theodora, the wife of
Justinian the Great, and after serving with distinction in the
Persian wars, and winning greater renown as a monk near Antioch,
came to Constantinople about the year 530, at the invitation of his
imperial relatives, to assist in the settlement of the theological
controversies of the day. Once there he was induced to make the
capital his permanent abode by permission to build a monastery,
where he could follow his high calling as fully as in his Syrian
retreat. For that purpose he selected a site on the property of a
certain Charisius, situated, as the Chora is, on the slope of a
hill, descending on the one hand steeply to the sea, and rising, on
the other, to the highest point in the line of the Theodosian
walls, the point marked by the gate named after Charisius (now
Edirn&eacute; Kapoussi). The site was already hallowed, says the
biographer of S. Theodore, by the presence of a humble monastic
retreat and a small chapel.</p>

<p>The edifice erected by S. Theodore was, however, soon overthrown
by the severe earthquake which shook the city in 558, and all the
hopes of the good man would also have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>been dashed to the
ground had the disaster not called forth the sympathy and aid of
Justinian. In the room of the ruined buildings the emperor erected
a magnificent establishment, with chapels dedicated to the
Theotokos, the Archangel Michael, S. Anthimus of Nicomedia, and the
Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. There also stood a hostel for the special
accommodation of Syrian monks on a visit to Constantinople, and a
hospital for diseases of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></p>

<p>In this account of the early history of the Chora, there may be,
as Schmitt<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> thinks, many inaccuracies.
It was easy, even for a member of the House who aspired to
authorship, to confuse persons, to err in the matter of dates, and
to overlook the changes which the buildings with which he was
familiar had undergone before his day. But surely the biographer of
S. Theodore can be trusted where his statements are supported by
more reliable authorities, and we may therefore accept his
testimony on the following points: that the original church of the
Chora was earlier than the reign of Justinian; that under Justinian
the old sanctuary was replaced by a new and statelier building;
that the Chora maintained intimate relations with monasteries in
Syria; and that with it was associated a church dedicated to the
Archangel Michael.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The association of a church dedicated to S. Michael with the
Chora, and the fact that the Chora stood on the property of
Charisius, raise an interesting question. For among the
subscriptions to the letter of the monks to Pope Hormisdas in 518,
and the subscriptions to the Acts of the Synod held in
Constantinople in 536, stands the name of the abbot of the
monastery of the Archangel Michael of Charisius.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Was that monastery identical with the Chora? If
it was, that fact would be additional evidence that the Chora was
earlier than Justinian's time. On the other hand, it is always
dangerous to identify buildings because they were situated in the
same quarter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the city and dedicated to the same saint.
The absence of all reference to the monastery of S. Michael of
Charisius after the reign of Justinian, and yet the association of
a church of S. Michael with the Chora after his reign, may be due
either to the ruin of that monastery in the earthquake of 558, or
to the subsequent union of the two establishments on account of
their proximity.</p>
</div>

<p>The next important event in the history of the House was the
confinement there of the celebrated general Priscus, Count of the
Excubiti, at the command of the Emperor Heraclius (610-641).<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> Priscus had taken a leading part in the
revolution which overthrew his father-in-law, the infamous Phocas,
and placed Heraclius upon the throne. But notwithstanding that
service, the attitude of the general towards the new r&eacute;gime
was not considered satisfactory, and with the cruel taunt, 'Wretch,
thou didst not make a good son-in-law; how canst thou be a true
friend?' Heraclius relegated him to political nonentity by forcing
him to become a monk at the Chora. The new brother did not live
long, but his wealth furnished the fraternity with the means for
the erection of a large and beautiful church.</p>

<p>Schmitt, indeed, thinks that the biographer of S. Theodore,
already cited, failed to recognise the identity of the person
concerning whom he wrote, and assigned events which occurred in the
time of Heraclius to the reign of Justinian. According to Schmitt,
S. Theodore is really Priscus under his name in religion, and to
him, and not to Justinian, was the Chora indebted for its first
great era of prosperity. One thing is certain, the splendid church
with which the biographer of S. Theodore was acquainted, and the
wealth and beauty of which he extols in extravagant terms, was not
the church erected by Justinian at the Chora. The latter was a
basilica;<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> while the church alluded
to in the biography of S. Theodore was a domical building.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> Probably the fame of Justinian veiled not only
what others had done for the Chora before him, but also the
services performed by others after his day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span> In 712 the Patriarch Kyros was confined
in the Chora by the Emperor Philippicus for adherence to the tenets
of the Sixth General Council (680),<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a>
which condemned the attribution of a single will to the person of
Christ. The fidelity of the patriarch to orthodox opinion was
commemorated annually in the services held at the Chora, as well as
in S. Sophia, on the 8th of January.</p>

<p>The monastery was also honoured by the burial there, in 740, of
the Patriarch Germanus (714-730), famous for his piety, his
learning, and above all for his opposition to Leo the Isaurian,
when that emperor commenced the crusade against eikons. The tomb of
the patriarch was reputed to perform wonderful cures.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> Another notable personage buried at the Chora
was the patrician Bactagius, an associate of Artavasdos in the
effort, made in 743, to drive Constantine Copronymus from the
throne. Upon the failure of that attempt Bactagius was captured,
beheaded in the Kynegion, and while his head was displayed to
public view in the Milion for three days, his mutilated body was
taken to the Chora. This might have seemed sufficient revenge. But
the rebel's offence so rankled in the emperor's memory, that even
after the lapse of some thirty years his resentment was not
allayed. The widow of Bactagius was then forced to proceed to the
Chora to disinter the bones of her husband from their resting-place
in holy earth, and carry them in her cloak to the dreary
burial-ground of Pelagion, where the corpses of persons who
committed suicide were thrown.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></p>

<p>Like similar institutions the Chora suffered severely during the
iconoclastic period. Because of its connection with the Patriarch
Germanus it became the special object of the hatred of Constantine
Copronymus for monks and was almost ruined. What he left of it was
turned into a secular residence, and devoted to the confinement of
Artavasdos and his family. There also that rebel, and his nine
children and his wife, Constantine's sister, were eventually
buried.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>With the triumph of the iconodules, in 842, under Michael III.
and his mother the Empress Theodora, happier days dawned upon the
Chora. It was then fortunate in the appointment of Michael
Syncellus as its abbot, and under his rule it rapidly recovered
from poverty and desolation. The new abbot was a Syrian monk
distinguished for his ability, his sanctity, and his devotion to
eikons. He came to Constantinople in 814, to remonstrate against
the religious policy of Leo the Armenian, and, according to the
custom of monks from Palestine on a visit to the capital, lodged at
the Chora. But so far from succeeding in the object of his visit,
Michael was imprisoned and then banished to one of the monasteries
on Mount Olympus in Bithynia. Accordingly, when the cause for which
he suffered proved victorious, no honour seemed too great to bestow
upon the martyr. It was even proposed to create him patriarch, but
he declined the office, and supported the appointment of his friend
Methodius to that position. Methodius, in return, made Michael his
syncellus and abbot of the Chora.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a>
Under these circumstances it is not surprising that funds were
secured for the restoration of the monastery, and that the
brotherhood soon gained great influence in the religious circles of
the capital. There is, however, no mention now of the church of the
Archangel Michael or of the church dedicated to the Theotokos.
Possibly the death of the abbot in 846 and lack of money prevented
the reconstruction of those sanctuaries. The only churches attached
to the Chora noticed in the biography of Michael Syncellus are the
church of S. Anthimus, containing the relics of S. Babylas and his
eighty-four disciples, the dependent chapel of S. Ignatius, and the
church of the Forty Martyrs.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a>
Let it also be noted that there is yet no mention of a church
specially consecrated to the Saviour.</p>

<p>After its restoration in the 9th century the Chora does not
appear again in history until the reign of Alexius I. Comnenus
(1081-1118), when, owing to its great age, it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span> was found
in a state of almost complete ruin.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>
If for no other reason, the proximity of the church to the palace
or Blachernae, which had become the favourite residence of the
court, brought the dilapidated pile into notice, and its
restoration was undertaken by the emperor's mother-in-law, Maria,
the beautiful and talented granddaughter of Samuel, the famous king
of Bulgaria, and niece of Aecatherina, the consort of Isaac I.
Comnenus. Maria had married Andronicus Ducas, a son of Michael
VII., and the marriage of her daughter Irene Ducaena to Alexius was
designed to unite the rival pretensions of the families of the
Comneni and the Ducas to the throne. It had been strenuously
opposed by Anna Dalassena, the mother of Alexius, and its
accomplishment in 1077, notwithstanding such formidable opposition,
is no slight proof of the diplomatic skill and determination of the
mother of the bride. Nor can it be doubted that Irene's mother
acted a considerable part in persuading Alexius, when he mounted
the throne, not to repudiate his young wife, as he was tempted to
do in favour of a fairer face. Perhaps the restoration of the Chora
was a token of gratitude for the triumph of her maternal
devotion.</p>

<p>The church was rebuilt on the plan which it presents to-day, for
in the account of the repairs made in the fourteenth century it is
distinctly stated that they concerned chiefly the outer portion of
the edifice.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> To Alexius' mother-in-law,
therefore, may be assigned the central part of the structure, a
cruciform hall; the dome, so far as it is not Turkish, the
beautiful marble incrustation upon the walls, the mosaic eikons of
the Saviour and of the Theotokos on the piers of the eastern
dome-arch, and the exquisite marble carving above the latter
eikon&mdash;all eloquent in praise of the taste and munificence
that characterised the eleventh century in Constantinople. Probably
the church was then dedicated to the Saviour, like the three other
Comnenian churches in the city, the Pantepoptes, the Pantokrator,
and S. Thekla.</p>

<p>The mother-in-law of Alexius I. was, however, not alone in her
interest in the Chora. Her devotion to the monastery was shared
also by her grandson the sebastocrator Isaac.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Tall, handsome, brave, but ambitious and wayward, Isaac was
gifted with the artistic temperament, as his splendid manuscript of
the first eight books of the Old Testament, embellished with
miniatures by his own hand, makes clear.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a>
If the inscription on the mosaic representing the Deesis found in
the inner narthex really refers to him, it proves that his
influence was felt in the decoration of the building.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> He certainly erected a magnificent mausoleum for
himself in the church. Later in his life, indeed, he became
interested in the restoration of the monastery of Theotokos
Kosmosoteira at Viros, and ordered that mausoleum to be dismantled,
and the marbles, bronze railing, and portraits of his parents which
adorned it to be transported to Viros; but he still allowed his own
portrait 'made in the days of his youthful vanity' to remain in the
Chora.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a></p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Uspenski has identified Viros with Ferejik, a village situated
30 kilometres from Dedeagatch, and 20-25 kilometres from Enos, 'aux
embouchures d&eacute;sert&eacute;es et mar&eacute;cageuses de la
Maritza.'</p>

<p>The church is now the mosque of the village. It has five domes
and three apses. The central apse is pierced by a modern door. The
exonarthex has disappeared and the old principal entrance is walled
up. The plan of the church is almost identical with the plan of the
Chora. While the architectural details are poor and indicate haste,
the dimensions of the building imply considerable expense and the
wealth of the restorer. There are traces of painting on the walls
of the interior, especially in the domes (the Virgin) and in the
two lateral apses. An epitaph of seven lines in the middle of the
mosque contains the title 'despotes.' According to Uspenski, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
sebastocrator died soon after 1182, the
year during which he was engaged on the Typicon of the monastery at
Viros. The monastery was visited by the Emperor Andronicus Comnenus
in 1185, by Isaac Angelus in 1195, and by Villehardouin in 1205.
Early in the fourteenth century it was converted into a fortress,
and the country round it was ravaged in 1322 by the Bulgarians. It
was attacked in vain by John Cantucuzene, but was captured in 1355
by John VI. Palaeologus.</p>

</p>

<p>Another name associated with the Chora at this period is that of
the Patriarch Cosmas, who was commemorated annually in the church
on the 2nd of January. He had occupied the patriarchal seat in days
troubled by the intrigues and conflicts which drove first Michael
VII. Ducas, and then Nicephorus Botoniates from the throne, and
invested Alexius Comnenus with the purple. They were not days most
suitable to a man who, though highly esteemed for his virtues, was
without education or experience in public affairs, and nearly
ninety years old. Still, to his honour be it said, it was at his
earnest request that Botoniates finally agreed to forego a bloody
contest with the Comneni, and to withdraw quietly to the monastery
of the Peribleptos. Moreover, when it seemed uncertain whether the
victorious Alexius would remain faithful to Irene Ducaena and raise
her to the throne, Cosmas, notwithstanding all the efforts of Anna
Dalassena (who was ill-disposed towards Irene) to persuade him to
lay down his office, firmly refused to resign until he had placed
the imperial crown upon the emperor's lawful wife. Soon after that
event, on the 7th of May 1081, the festival of S. John the
Evangelist, Cosmas, having celebrated service in the church
dedicated to that apostle at the Hebdomon (Makrikeui), turned to
his deacon, saying, 'Take my Psalter and come with me; we have
nothing more to do here,' and retired to the monastery of Kallou.
His strength for battle was spent.</p>

<p>After its restoration under the Comneni, the Chora again
disappears from view until the reign of Michael Palaeologus
(1261-1282). In the interval the fortunes of the Empire had
suffered serious reverses, what with domestic strifes and foreign
wars. Bulgaria had reasserted her independence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span> and
established the capital of a new kingdom at Tirnovo, while
Constantinople itself had been captured by the forces of the Fourth
Crusade and made the seat of a Latin kingdom. Consequently, it is
not surprising to find that the Chora, like other churches of the
ravaged city, was in a deplorable condition at the close of those
calamitous days. Nothing seemed to have been done for the repair of
the church immediately upon the recovery of the capital in 1261.
The ruin which the Latin occupants of Constantinople left behind
them was too great to be removed at once. The first reference to
the Chora at this period occurs some fourteen years after the
restoration of the Byzantine Empire, when the monastery, owing to
its proximity to the palace of Blachernae, was assigned to the
Patriarch Veccus as the house in which to lodge on the occasion of
his audiences with Michael Palaeologus, on Tuesdays, to present
petitions for the exercise of imperial generosity or justice. But
the decay into which the establishment had fallen could not be long
ignored, and a wealthy, talented, and influential citizen who
resided in the neighbourhood, Theodore Metochites,<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> decided to restore the edifice as a monument of
the artistic revival of his own day.</p>

<p>Theodore Metochites was one of the most remarkable men of his
day. His tall, large, well-proportioned figure, his bright
countenance, commanded attention wherever he appeared. He was,
moreover, a great student of ancient Greek literature and of the
literature of later times, and although never a master of style,
became an author and attempted verse. He was much interested in
astronomy, and one of his pupils, the historian Nicephorus
Gregoras, recognised the true length of the year and proposed the
reform of the calendar centuries before Pope Gregory. Theodore's
memory was so retentive that he could converse on any topic with
which he was familiar, as if reading from a book, and there was
scarcely a subject on which he was not able to speak with the
authority of an expert. He seemed a living library, 'walking
encyclopaedia.' In fact, he belonged to the class of brilliant
Greek scholars who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
might have regenerated the East had not
the unfortunate political situation of their country driven them to
Italy to herald and promote the Renaissance in Western Europe.
Theodore Metochites was, moreover, a politician. He took an active
part in the administration of affairs during the reign of
Andronicus II., holding the office of Grand Logothetes of the
Treasury; and such was his devotion to politics, that when acting
as a statesman it might be forgotten that he was a scholar. The
unhappy strife between Andronicus II. and Andronicus III. caused
Theodore Metochites the profoundest anxiety, and it was not his
fault if the feud between the grandfather and the grandson refused
to be healed. His efforts to bring that disgraceful and disastrous
quarrel to an end involved great self-sacrifice and wrecked his
career. For the counsels he addressed to Andronicus III. gave
mortal offence, and when the young emperor entered the capital and
took up his quarters in the palace of the Porphyrogenitus (Tekfour
Serai), his troops sacked and demolished Theodore's mansion in that
vicinity. The beautiful marbles which adorned the residence were
sent as an imperial present to a Scythian prince, while the fallen
statesman was banished to Didymotica for two years. Upon his return
from exile Theodore found a shelter in the monastery which he had
restored in his prosperous days. But there also, for some two years
longer, the cup of sorrow was pressed to his lips. A malady from
which he suffered caused him excruciating pain; his sons were
implicated in a political plot and thrown into prison; Andronicus
II., between whom and himself all communication had been forbidden,
died; and so the worn-out man assumed the habit of a monk, and lay
down to die on the 13th of March 1331, a month after his imperial
friend. His one consolation was the beautiful church he bequeathed
to succeeding generations for the worship of God.</p>

<p>To the renovation of the church Theodore Metochites devoted
himself heart and soul, and spent money for that object on a lavish
scale. As the central portion of the building was comparatively
well preserved,<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> it was to the outer
part of the edifice that he directed his chief attention&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>two narthexes and the parecclesion. These
were to a large extent rebuilt and decorated with the marbles and
mosaics, which after six centuries, and notwithstanding the neglect
and injuries they have suffered during the greater part of that
period, still excite the admiration they awakened when fresh from
the artist's hand.</p>

<p>The connection of Theodore Metochites with this splendid work is
immortalised not only by historians of his day and by himself,<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> but also by the mosaic which surmounts the
main entrance to the church from the inner narthex. There the
restorer of the building, arrayed in his official robes, and on
bended knees, holds a model of the church in his hands and offers
it to the Saviour seated on a throne. Beside the kneeling figure is
the legend, &#8001; &kappa;&tau;&#8053;&tau;&omega;&rho;
&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&theta;&#8051;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;

&Theta;&epsilon;&#8057;&delta;&omega;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#8001;
&Mu;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;&chi;&#8055;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, 'The
builder, Logothetes of the Treasury, Theodore the Metochites' (Plate <a href="#p_91">XCI.</a>).</p>

<p>The restoration of the church must have been completed before
the year 1321, for in that year Nicephorus Gregoras<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> describes it as then recently
(&#7940;&rho;&tau;&iota;) renovated, and in use for the celebration
of divine service. How long before 1321 the work of repair
precisely commenced cannot be determined, but it was in process as
early as 1303, for that date is inscribed in Arabic numerals on the
mosaic depicting the miracle at Cana, which stands to the right of
the figure of Christ over the door leading from the outer to the
inner narthex. But to have reached the stage at which mosaics could
be applied the work of restoration must have been commenced
sometime before 1303.</p>

</p>

<p>One of the most distinguished members of the Chora was the
historian Nicephorus Gregoras, who learned to know the monastery
through his friendship with Theodore Metochites. The two men met
first when Nicephorus came from his native town Heraclea on the
Black Sea to Constantinople, a youth eager to acquire the knowledge
that flourished in the capital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span> Being specially interested
in the science of astronomy, the student placed himself under the
instruction of Theodore, then the greatest authority on the
subject, and won the esteem and confidence of his master to a
degree that ripened into the warmest friendship and the most
unreserved intellectual intercourse. In his turn, Nicephorus
Gregoras became the instructor of the children of the grand
logothetes, and was treated as a member of the family. He was also
associated with the restoration of the Chora, attending
particularly to the collection of the costly materials required for
the embellishment of the church. Thus the monastery became his home
from youth to old age, and after Theodore's death was entrusted to
his care.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> During the fierce
controversy which raged around the question whether the light
beheld at the Transfiguration formed part of the divine essence,
and could be seen again after prolonged fasting and gazing upon
one's navel, as the monks of Mount Athos and their supporters
maintained, Nicephorus Gregoras, who rejected that idea, retired
from public life to defend what he deemed the cause of truth more
effectively. But to contend with a master of legions is ever an
unequal struggle. The Emperor John Cantacuzene, taking the side of
the monks, condemned their opponent to silence in the Chora, and
there for some three years Nicephorus Gregoras discovered how
scenes of happiness can be turned into a veritable hell by imperial
disfavour and theological odium. Notwithstanding his age, his
physical infirmities, his services to the monastery, his
intellectual eminence, he was treated by the fraternity in a manner
so inhuman that he would have preferred to be exposed on the
mountains to wild beasts. He was obliged to fetch water for himself
from the monastery well, and when, on one occasion, he was laid up
for several days by an injury to his foot, none of the brothers
ever thought of bringing him water. In winter he was allowed no
fire, and he had often to wait till the frozen water in his cell
was melted by the sun before he could wash or drink. The vision of
the light <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>of the Transfiguration did not transfigure
the character of its beholders.</p>

<p>During this trying period of his life one ray of comfort
wandered into the cell of the persecuted man. On the 13th December
1351, in the dead of night, while the precincts of the monastery
were crowded with worshippers attending the vigil of the festival
of the Conception of the Theotokos, a strange figure climbed into
the prisoner's room through an open window. It proved to be an old
friend and former pupil named Agathangelus, who had not been seen
for ten years owing to his absence from the city. Taking advantage
of the darkness and of the absorption of the monks in the services
of the festival, he had made this attempt to visit his revered
master. Eagerly and hurriedly, for the time at their command was
short, the two friends recounted the story of their lives while
separated. Rapidly Agathangelus sketched the course of affairs in
State and Church since the seclusion of Nicephorus Gregoras; and
the brief visit ended and seemed a dream. But the devoted disciple
was not satisfied with a single interview. Six months later he
contrived to see his master again, and, encouraged by success, saw
him again three times, though at long intervals, during the three
years that Nicephorus Gregoras was detained in the Chora. One great
object of these visits was to keep the prisoner informed of events
in the world beyond the walls of his cell, and on the basis of the
information thus supplied Nicephorus Gregoras wrote part of his
important history. When at length, in 1354, John Cantucuzene was
driven from the throne, and John Palaeologus reigned in his stead,
Nicephorus was liberated,<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a>
and to the last defended the opinions for which he had
suffered.</p>

<p>Another name associated with the Chora at this time is that of
Michael Tornikes, Grand Constable in the reign of Andronicus II. He
was related, on his mother's side, to the emperor, and stood in
high favour at court not only on account of that kinship, but
because of the talents, character, and administrative ability which
he displayed.
He was, moreover, a friend of Theodore Metochites, and <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>his
political supporter in the efforts made to end the strife between
Andronicus II. and Andronicus III.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a>
Upon his death, Tornikes was buried in the parecclesion of the
Chora, and the epitaph composed in his honour has kept its place
there to this day (Plate <a href="#p_92">XCII.</a>).</p>

<p>In 1342, Sabbas, a monk of the monastery of Vatopedi, who came
to Constantinople as a member of a deputation from Mount Athos to
reconcile the Regent Anna of Savoy with Cantacuzene, was confined
in the Chora on the failure of that mission.<a name="FNanchor_535"
id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a></p>

<p>In view of its proximity to the landward walls, the Chora
acquired great importance during the fatal siege of 1453. For the
inhabitants of the beleagured capital placed their hope for
deliverance more upon the saints they worshipped than upon their
own prowess; the spiritual host enshrined in their churches was
deemed mightier than the warriors who manned the towers of the
fortifications. The sanctuaries beside the walls constituted the
strongest bulwarks from which the 'God protected city' was to be
defended, not with earthly, but with heavenly weapons. The eikon of
the Theotokos Hodegetria was, therefore, taken to the Chora to
guard the post of danger.</p>

<p>It represented the Theotokos as the Leader of God's people in
war, and around it gathered memories of wonderful deliverances and
glorious triumphs, making it seem the banner of wingless victory.
When the Saracens besieged the city the eikon was carried round the
fortifications, and the enemy had fled. It led Zimisces in his
victorious campaign against the Russians; it was borne round the
fortifications when Branas assailed the capital in the reign of
Isaac Angelus, and the foe disappeared; and when Constantinople was
recovered from the Latins, Michael Palaeologus only expressed the
general sentiment in placing the eikon on a triumphal car, and
causing it to enter the city before him, while he humbly followed
on foot as far as the Studion. But the glory of the days of old had
departed, and no sooner did the troops of Sultan Mehemed force the
Gate of Charisius (Edirn&eacute; Kapoussi) than they made for the
Chora, and cut the image to pieces. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>The church of S. Saviour in
the Chora was the first Christian sanctuary to fall into the hands
of the Moslem masters of Constantinople.</p>

<p>The building was converted into a mosque by Ali Atik Pasha,
Grand Vizier, between 1495 and 1511, in the reign of Bajazet II.
Gyllius visited the church in 1580, and expatiates upon the beauty
of its marble revetment, but makes no reference to its mosaics and
frescoes.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> This, some authorities
think, proves that these decorations were then concealed from view,
because objectionable in a place consecrated to Moslem worship. But
the silence of the traveller may be due to the brevity of his
description of the church.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the building has suffered much since the
Turkish conquest from earthquake and from fire, but the precise
dates of these disasters cannot be accurately determined. The
mosque disappeared from general view until 1860, when it was
discovered by a Greek architect, the late Pelopidas D. Kouppas. Mr.
Carlton Cumberbatch, then the British Consul at Constantinople, was
informed of the fact and spread the news of the fortunate find.</p>

<p>The building was in a pitiful condition. The principal dome and
the dome of the diaconicon had fallen in; the walls and vaults were
cracked in many places and black with smoke; wind, and rain, and
snow had long had free course to do what mischief they pleased.
Happily there still remained too much beauty to be ignored, and the
Government was persuaded to take the work of restoration in hand.
The building now takes rank with the most <span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>interesting sights of
the capital, presenting one of the finest embodiments of the ideal
which inspired Byzantine art.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Architectural Features</i></div>

<p>As the history of the church prepares us to expect, the building
presents a very irregular plan. The central area is a short-armed
Greek cross surmounted by a dome, and terminating to the east in a
large apse flanked by side chapels now disconnected from it. To the
west are two narthexes, on the south a parecclesion, and on the
north a gallery in two stories.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="fig_99" id="fig_99"></a> <img src="images/fig_99.png" width="500" height="299"
alt="Details from the Church." title="" />
 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.

</div>

<p>As the central part of the church is the oldest and of the
greatest interest, the description will begin with the interior,
and deal afterwards with the later exterior accretions.</p>

<p>Only two doors lead from the inner narthex to the church, one of
them in the centre of the axis and the other to the north. The
absence of the corresponding and customary third door, for which
there is space on the south side, should be noticed, as it throws
light on the original plan of the building. The doors are
beautifully treated with marble mouldings and panelled ingoes; the
door to the north recalls the sculptured door in the south gallery
of S. Sophia, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>but, unfortunately, the carved work of the
panels has been destroyed. Above the central door, on the interior,
is a porphyry cornice carved with peacocks drinking at fountains
(Plate <a href="#p_87">LXXXVII.</a>). Large portions of the
beautiful marble revetment on the walls of the church happily
remain intact, and nowhere else in Constantinople, except in S.
Sophia, can this splendid method of colour decoration be studied to
greater advantage. Slabs of various marbles have been split and
placed on the walls so as to form patterns in the veining. The
lower part is designed as a dado in Proconessian striped marble,
with upright posts of dark red at the angles and at intervals on
the longer stretches of wall, and rests on a moulded marble base.
Above the dado are two bands, red and green, separated from the
dado and from each other by white fillets. The upper part is filled
in with large panels, especially fine slabs of brown, green, or
purple having been selected to form the centre panels. The plainer
slabs of the side panels are framed in red or green borders, and
outlined with fillets of white marble either plain or carved with
the 'bead and reel.' The arches have radiating voussoirs, and the
arch spandrils and the frieze under the cornice are inlaid with
scroll and geometrical designs in black, white, and coloured
marbles. The cornice is of grey marble with a 'cyma recta' section,
and is carved with an upright leaf.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></p>

<p>On the eastern walls of the north and south cross arms, and
flanking the apse, eikon frames similar to those in the Diaconissa
(p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>) are inserted. The northern frame
encloses a mosaic figure of Christ holding in His hands an open
book, on which are the words, 'Come unto Me all ye who labour and
are heavy laden.'<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> In the corresponding
frame to the south is the figure of the Virgin, and, above it, an
arch of overhanging acanthus leaves enclosed within a square frame
with half figures of angels in the spandrils. The arch encloses a
medallion bust, the head of which is defaced, but which represented
the Saviour, as is proved by the indication of a cross on the
aureola. The spaces at the sides of the medallion are filled in
with a pierced scroll showing a dark slab of porphyry behind it,
making a very beautiful arrangement. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>These frames are distant
from the eikonostasis, which stretched across the front of the bema
arch, nearer to the apse. On the south side are two doors leading
to the parecclesion, and on the north side above the cornice is a
small window from the north gallery.</p>

<p>The dome rests on a ribbed drum of sixteen concave segments, and
is pierced by eight windows corresponding to the octagonal form of
the exterior. The original crown has fallen and been replaced by
the present plain Turkish dome. The prothesis and the diaconicon
are represented by chapels to north and south of the apse. As
already stated, they do not now communicate with the bema, although
the position of the old passages between them and the bema is
marked by niches in the marble revetment. From the fact that the
Byzantine marble work is continued across these passages it is
evident that the chapels were cut off from the apse in Byzantine
days. The north chapel is covered by a drum dome of eight concave
sections, and is entered from the lower story of the gallery on the
north side of the church. It should be noticed that the chapel is
not placed axially to this gallery. The south chapel is covered by
a plain drum dome, and is now entered from the parecclesion,
evidently as the result of the alterations made when the
parecclesion was added.</p>

<p>The exterior is very simply treated. The side apses show three
sides of an octagon. The central apse has five sides of a very flat
polygon, and is decorated with hollow niches on each side of a
large triple window. It was at one time supported by a large double
flying buttress, but the lower arch has fallen in. As the buttress
does not bond with the wall it was evidently a later addition.</p>

<p>The inner narthex is entered from the outer narthex by a door to
the west. It is with its resplendent marble revetment and brilliant
mosaics a singularly perfect and beautiful piece of work, one of
the finest gems of Byzantine Art. It is divided into four bays, and
is not symmetrically placed to the church. The door stands opposite
to the large door of the church and is in the central axis of the
building. The bay which it occupies and that immediately<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span> to
the north are covered by dome vaults resting on strong transverse
arches and shallow segmental wall arches.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a>
The northern end bay is covered with a drum dome of sixteen hollow
segments pierced by eight windows. The bay to the south of the door
is considerably larger than the other bays, and is covered by a
dome similar in character to that over the northern end bay but of
greater diameter. At the south end of the narthex a small door
leads to the return bay of the outer narthex in front of the
parecclesion.</p>

<p>The double-storied annex or gallery on the north of the building
is entered by a door in the north bay of the inner narthex. The
lower story is covered by a barrel vault with strong transverse
arches at intervals. Its door to the outside at the west end is now
built up. At the east end a door, unsymmetrically placed, leads to
the small chapel which was originally the prothesis. This story of
the gallery seems never to have had windows. The upper story,
reached by a stone stair at the west end in the thickness of the
external wall, is paved in red tiles, covered with a barrel vault,
and lighted by two small windows in the north wall and one at the
east end. These windows still show grooves and bolt holes for
casement windows or shutters opening inwards in two leaves (Figs. <a href="#fig_19">19,</a> <a href="#fig_100">100</a>). In the
south wall is the little window overlooking the church.</p>

<p>The outer narthex has a single door to the exterior, placed on
the central axial line, and is planned symmetrically. The central
bay is larger than the others, and is covered by a dome vault
resting on shallow wall arches. On each side are two bays covered
by similar dome vaults, but as the bays are oblong, the wall arches
are brought forward strongly so as to give a form more approaching
the square as a base for the dome. The transverse arches are
strongly pronounced and have wooden tie beams. At the south end two
bays are returned to form an entrance to the parecclesion. In these
the transverse arches are even more stro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>ngly marked and rest on
marble columns set against shallow pilasters. The cubical capitals
are of white marble and very beautifully carved with figures of
angels and acanthus wreaths. Any marble revetment which may once
have covered the walls has disappeared, but mosaics depicting
scenes in the Saviour's life still decorate the vaulting and the
lunettes of the arches, whilst figures of saints appear upon the
soffits. The mosaics are damaged and have lost some of their
brilliancy; the background is of gold, and the mosaic cubes are
small, averaging about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of an inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.

</div>

<p>The parecclesion is entered from the return bays of the outer
narthex through a triple arcade, now partly built up. The capitals
of the columns are Byzantine Corinthian, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>retain
sufficient traces of their former decoration in dark blue, gold,
and red to give some idea of the effect of colour on marble in
Byzantine churches.</p>

<p>The parecclesion is in two bays. The western bay is covered by a
high twelve-sided drum dome, with windows in each side separated by
flat ribs. In the compartments are figures of the archangels in
tempera, with the legend, 'Holy Holy, Holy, is the Lord God.'</p>

<p>The eastern bay is covered by a dome vault, and terminates in an
apse semicircular within and lighted by a triple window. It has
neither prothesis nor diaconicon of its own, but communicates with
the original diaconicon of the main church. The three transverse
arches in the bay are tied with wooden tie beams carved with
arabesques and retaining traces of gilding.</p>

<p>On the north and south walls of the western bay are large arches
enclosed in square frames and with finely carved archivolts. Above
the south arch is a slab inscribed with the epitaph to the memory
of the celebrated general Tornikes. There are no indications of an
entrance under the arch. It may have covered a niche, now built up,
intended to receive a tomb, possibly the tomb of the sebastocrator
Isaac.</p>

<p>The archivolt of the arch in the north wall is formed of
acanthus leaves turned over at the points; the spandrils are filled
with the figures of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, bearing
appropriate emblems, and above the crown of the arch is a small
bust of Christ. In both arches the carved work is exactly like that
of the eikon frame in the south-eastern pier of the church, and
closely resembles the work on the lintel of the eikon frames in the
church of the Diaconissa. Both archivolts were originally coloured,
the background blue, the carved ornament gilt. The use of figures
in the decoration of the church is remarkable. They are in bold
relief and executed freely, but shown only from the waist up. The
windows, like those in the outer narthex, have a central arch
between two semi-circles (Fig. <a href="#fig_63">63</a>).</p>

</p>

<p>Two passages, which cut through the north wall, lead <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>from
the parecclesion to the church. Off the passage to the west is a
small chamber whose use is not apparent. It may be simply a space
left over when the chapel was added. Higher up, in the thickness of
the wall, about ten feet from the floor, and a little above the
springing level of the vaulting in the parecclesion, is a long,
narrow passage, lighted by a window at the east end, and covered by
a small barrel vault, corbelled at the springing, on two courses of
stone and three courses of brick laid horizontally, thus narrowing
the space to a considerable degree. From this corbelling spring the
vaulting courses, which are steeply inclined and run from both ends
to the centre, where the resultant diamond-shaped opening is filled
in with horizontal courses (Fig. <a href="#fig_48">48</a>). On the
north side of the passage is a broad opening roughly built up, but
which seems originally to have communicated with the south cross
arm. The opening is almost central to the cross-arm, and is
directly above the doors leading from the church to the
parecclesion.</p>

<p>The exterior of the parecclesion and the outer narthex are
treated with arcades in two orders of the usual type. On the piers
of the arcades are semicircular shafts which in the parecclesion
rise to the cornice, but on the west front stop at the springing
course. Here they may have supported the wooden roof of a cloister
or porch. The apse of the parecclesion has five sides with angle
shafts and niches, alternately flat and concave in three stories.
The north wall is a fine example of simple masonry in stripes of
brick and stone, and with small archings and zigzag patterns in the
spandrils of the arches.</p>

<p>Below the parecclesion are two long narrow cisterns having their
entrance on the outside of the apse.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></p>

<p><i>The original plan of the church</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig_102">102</a>).
The greater part of the alterations made in the church
date from Byzantine times, and the marble coverings then placed
upon the walls <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>have effectually covered up any traces
which might have given a clue to the original form of the building.
In consequence any attempt at restoration must be of a very
tentative character.</p>

<p>It is evident that there has been a serious movement in the
structure due to the weight of the dome and the thrust of the dome
arches, for the walls below the dome are bent outwards in a very
pronounced manner. It was in order to check this movement that the
flying buttress was applied to the apse, and in all probability the
enormous thickness of the walls surrounding the central cross is
due to the same cause. Had the walls originally been as thick as at
present it is hard to imagine that movement could have taken
place.</p>

<p>The axial line from east to west, passing through the doors of
both narthexes, divides the present building into two dissimilar
parts. We know that the parecclesion is a later addition, and if it
be removed and the plan of the north side repeated to the south the
resulting plan bears a striking resemblance to S. Sophia at
Salonica (Fig. <a href="#fig_101">101</a>). The position of the
prothesis and diaconicon in particular is identical in the two
churches.</p>

<p>Some proof that this was the original form of the building is
given by the small chamber in the wall thickness between the church
and the parecclesion. For it corresponds to the angle of the south
'aisle,' and on its west wall is a vertical break in the masonry
which may be the jamb of the old door to the narthex.</p>

<p>This plan gives a narthex in five bays&mdash;the three centre
ones low, the two outer covered by domes and leading to the
'aisles.' When the parecclesion was added, the south gallery and
two bays of the inner narthex were swept away. The third door
leading into the church was built up, and the present large domed
bay added to the shortened narthex.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.&mdash;S.

</div>

<p>Traces of the older structure remain in the wall between the
church and the parecclesion. The space already described, which
originally opened from the passage at the higher level to the south
cross-arm, corresponds in width both to the window above and to the
space occupied by the doors below. At S. Sophia, Salonica, the
side-arms are filled <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span> in with arcades in two stories forming an
aisle and gallery. This is the normal domed basilica construction.
Here, if we regard the floor of the upper passage (B on plan, p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>) as the remains of the old gallery
floor,&mdash;and no other view seems to account for its
existence,&mdash;the internal elevation was in three stories, an
aisle at the ground level, above it a gallery, and above that, in
the arch tympanum, a triple window. Such an arrangement is, so far
as we know, unique in a small church, but it is the arrangement
used in S. Sophia, Constantinople, and may well have been derived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>from that church. The opening is only
about one-half of the space, leaving a broad pier at each side. In
this it differs from S. Sophia, Salonica, but such side piers are
present in S. Sophia, Constantinople. The diagrams show a
restoration of the plan and internal bay based on these conclusions
(Figs. <a href="#fig_102">102,</a> <a href="#fig_103">103</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The gallery on the north side is an addition. The character of
the brickwork and of the windows is later than the central church,
but the lack of windows on the ground floor suggests that the
'aisle' was originally lighted from the body of the church. The
vaulting gives no clue, nor are there traces of an opening in the
wall between the 'aisle' and the church. The floor level is much
higher than that of the passage 'B' (p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>) on the opposite side, and seems to be a new level
introduced when the addition was made and the wall thickened.</p>

<p>If these conclusions are correct the church was originally <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>a
domed basilica resembling S. Sophia, Salonica, in plan and S.
Sophia, Constantinople, in elevation. The side dome arches had
double arcades in two stories, and above them windows in the dome
arches. There are at present no traces of a western gallery, but
such may have existed below the present west windows. Later in the
history of the church came alterations, which included the ribbed
domes and the gallery on the north side. The side aisles still
communicated with the church and the lateral chapels with the
bema.</p>

</div>

<p>The filling up of the arcades, the thickening of the walls, the
isolation of the lateral chapels, the removal of the southern
aisle, the alteration of the narthex, the building of the
parecclesion and outer narthex, and most of the decoration which
forms the glory of the church, belong to the great work of
restoration by Theodore Metochites early in the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>The representation of the church in the mosaic panel above the
large door to the church shows a building with a central dome, a
narthex terminating in domed bays, and a window in the west dome
arch. It seems to represent the church as the artist was accustomed
to see it previous to the additions (Fig. <a href="#fig_115">115</a>).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<h4>THE MOSAICS IN S. SAVIOUR IN THE CHORA</h4>

<p>As stated already, the mosaics on the vaults and lunettes of the
arches in the outer narthex of the church portray scenes from the
life of Christ, as recorded in the canonical and the apocryphal
Gospels, while on the faces and soffits of the arches are depicted
the figures of saints 'who desired to look into these things.'
Scenes from the Saviour's life are also portrayed in the two bays
to the west of the parecclesion, and in the domes and southern bay
of the inner narthex. Inscriptions on the mosaics explain the
subjects depicted. The scenes will be described according to the
groups they form in the compartments of the narthex.<br />

<p>The scenes represented on these mosaics are not peculiar to this
church, but are a selection from cycles of subjects which from the
eleventh century became favourite themes for pictorial treatment on
the walls of important churches in the Byzantine world. Several of
these scenes are found portrayed also at Daphni, Mistra, S. Sophia
at Kiev, in the churches of Mt. Athos, on diptychs and
manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> as well as in the chapel
of the arena at Padua. The cycle of subjects taken from the life of
Mary was developed mainly in Syria, and Schmitt<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> goes so far as to maintain that the mosaics of
the Chora are copies of Syrian mosaics executed by a Syrian artist,
when the church was restored in the ninth century by Michael
Syncellus, who, it will be remembered, came from Syria.</p>

<p>Kondakoff assigns most of the mosaics to the Comnenian
restoration of the church by Maria Ducaena in the eleventh or
twelfth century. One of them at least, the De&euml;sis, has
survived; and there may be others of that period, for, as that
mosaic proves, the narthex of the church was decorated when <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>the
church was restored by that benefactress of the Chora. But the
testimony of Nicephorus Gregoras,<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a>
of Theodore Metochites,<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a>
and the date marked on the scene representing the miracle of the
wine at Cana, on the right of the figure of Christ over the door
leading from the outer to the inner narthex, prove these mosaics to
be as a whole the production of the fourteenth century. And this
conclusion is confirmed by their unlikeness to mosaic work in the
twelfth century, and by their affinity to other work of the same
character done in the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></p>

<p>In fact, the mosaics in the Chora represent a remarkable revival
in the history of Byzantine art. They are characterised by a
comparative freedom from tradition, by closer approximation to
reality and nature, by a charm and a sympathetic quality, and by a
scheme of colour that indicate the coming of a new age and spirit.
Curiously enough, they are contemporary with the frescoes of Giotto
at Padua (1303-1306). But whatever points of similarity may be
detected between them and the work of the Italian artist, or
between them and the Italian school before Giotto, should be
explained as due to a common stock of traditions and to the
simultaneous awakening of a new intellectual and artistic life in
the East and the West, rather than to any direct influence of one
school of art upon another. The mosaics of the Chora are thoroughly
Byzantine.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<h4>THE DATING AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CHURCHES</h4>

<p>The dating of the Constantinople churches is a problem of great
difficulty, and, in the absence of documentary evidence, we must
often be contented with very indefinite suggestions. Many churches
are known to have been founded at dates which are evidently earlier
than the existing buildings, and have apparently been rebuilt at
some later date of which the record has been lost. Other churches
are known to have been 'repaired,' and here the question of how far
'repair' means 'rebuilding' is sometimes insoluble. Repair may mean
simply a fresh coat of paint.</p>

<p>The architectural characteristics afford a certain clue, and the
following chronological scheme has been drawn up by their
guidance:&mdash;</p>

<p>The pre-Justinian period is characterised by simple construction
and detail of a late Roman type. Of this we have one
example&mdash;the basilica of S. John of the Studion, founded about
463. The existing building appears to be original.</p>

<p>The Justinian period commences with the beginning of the sixth
century. It is characterised by the development of the drumless
dome on pendentives. The plan is complicated, and the buildings are
large in comparison with those of later date. To this period belong
SS. Sergius and Bacchus (527 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>), the
baptistery of S. Sophia, and the 'Great Church' of S. Sophia
itself. S. Andrew in Krisei and S. Saviour in the Chora probably
date from this period. The carved detail of the former closely
resembles that of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>SS. Sergius and Bacchus, and the plan of
the latter connects it with S. Sophia, Salonica (sixth
century).</p>

<p>The Justinian period roughly includes the seventh century, and
is followed by a long decline, marked by the great iconoclastic
controversy which lasted almost until the middle of the ninth
century. To this period belongs S. Irene (740 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>). In plan it is a double-domed cross church. In
the arrangement of the dome-arches and galleries it resembles S.
Theodosia, whilst in the presence of a western gallery over the
narthex and in the number of columns in the 'nave arcade' it is
like S. Sophia.</p>

<p>The accession of Basil the Macedonian (867 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) marks the beginning of the second great
period&mdash;the 'Basilian Renaissance.' We know that this was a
period of great religious activity, and though we have,
unfortunately, no known dates to guide us, the development of plan
leads us to place a group of churches in the ninth, tenth, and
eleventh centuries. These are S. Mary Pammakaristos, S. Mary
Panachrantos, S. Theodosia, S. Mary Diaconissa, and SS. Peter and
Mark.</p>

<p>They are all churches of considerable size; S. Mary Diaconissa
and S. Theodosia being indeed large. They are characterised by the
use of the ambulatory and domed cross plans. The carving is coarse
and the capitals are of the clumsy Byzantine Corinthian type. The
dome is raised on a high drum in S. Mary Pammakaristos and S. Mary
Panachrantos, though this may be a later addition. The domes of the
other three churches seem to be Turkish. S. Mary Pammakaristos and
the south church in S. Mary Panachrantos are identical in plan with
S. Andrew in Krisei, and it would be possible to date them earlier
had we any evidence whatsoever. Unfortunately both have been very
much altered.</p>

<p>S. Theodosia, S. Mary Diaconissa, and SS. Peter and Mark, taken
in this order, form a series showing the gradual disappearance of
the galleries and the evolution of the domed cross church into the
'four columned' church of the next period.</p>

<p>The Myrelaion (919-945), if the present church is of <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>that
date, is an unusually early example of this four-columned type. It
is generally considered that this plan type dates at the earliest
from the eleventh century. There is, however, no reason to believe
that the church was rebuilt later; it is a perfectly normal example
of its class, and nowhere is an early example more probable than in
Constantinople. The Myrelaion may accordingly be taken as marking
the commencement of the late Byzantine period in
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The churches are now smaller; the gynecaeum, where present, is
placed over the narthex; the use of patterning in the brickwork of
the exterior, which occurs in some of the Basilian churches
(<i>e.g.</i> the cornice of S. Theodosia), now becomes important,
and alternate coursing in brick and stone is used with great
effect. From this time onwards narthexes were frequently added to
the existing churches.</p>

<p>S. Saviour Pantokrator (1118-1143 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) is the largest late church in Constantinople,
and is an unusually large church of its type. S. Saviour
Pantepoptes (1081-1118), S. Theodore, and S. John in Trullo, belong
to the same class. The last, with its circular dome and apse, is
probably the latest of the three. S. Thekla (1057-1059) and Bogdan
Serai are examples of hall churches of the same period.</p>

<p>The monastery of Manuel was founded in 829-842 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, but the building believed to be the refectory
is probably much later. As part of the monastery it might, of
course, have been built at any date subsequent to the foundation of
the House.</p>

<p>The architecture of the Sanjakdar does not correspond to the
date of the foundation of the monastery of the Gastria in the ninth
century. The building is certainly of late date, subsequent to the
eleventh century. Of the Balaban Mesjedi it is impossible to say
anything. It is the remnant of some Byzantine structure.</p>

<p>From 1204 to 1261, during the Latin Empire, we need not look for
much building in the Greek Church. Soon after the fall of that
empire comes the erection of S. Mary of the Mongols (1261-1282) and
Monastir Jamissi (1282-1328). In both cases the architectural
character is what we should expect. Following on this we have, in
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>fourteenth century, the alterations made
in S. Saviour in the Chora (<i>c.</i> 1300), and the parecclesion
of the Pammakaristos (<i>c.</i> 1315).</p>

<p>This was the last effort of pure Byzantine architecture in
Constantinople. During the hundred years preceding the Turkish
conquest in 1453 the gradually increasing pressure from the East
put a stop to all architectural schemes; the craftsmen and artists
fled to Italy, and there took their part in the great revival known
as 'The Renaissance.'</p>
